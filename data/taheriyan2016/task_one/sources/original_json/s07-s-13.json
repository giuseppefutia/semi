The term \"Rockingham\" derives from an English factory on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham that produced ceramic objects from 1745 until 1842. The factory became known for its mottled manganese-brown glazes and for its relief-molded decorations, often in the revived Rococo style (characterized by the use of leaf and flower motifs, curves and sinuous lines, and organic forms). When pottery manufacturers in the eastern United States and Ohio began to produce wares with similar glazes and designs in the early nineteenth century, the objects became known as \"American Rockingham.\"", "category": "American Art", "dates": "c. 1840-45", "name": "Manufacture attributed to American Pottery Manufacturing Company", "title": "Pitcher", "technique": "Glazed earthenware (American Rockingham ware)", "ac_id": "2008-25-18", "image_url": "http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/2008-25-18-ov.jpg", "dimension": "10 7/16 x 8 11/16 x 8 1/16 inches (26.5 x 22.1 x 20.5 cm)"}, {"origin": "Made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, North and Central America", "credit_line": "Gift of Eliza Amanda Tucker in memory of Mary Earp Tucker, 1931", "birth_and_death_years": "1835 - 1837", "audio_url": "", "nationality": "Philadelphia", "tags": "gold", "Label_on_page": "", "category": "American Art", "dates": "1837", "name": "Made by American Porcelain Company (formerly Tucker Factory)", "title": "Toilet Bottle with Stopper", "technique": "Porcelain with enamel and gilt decoration", "ac_id": "1931-55-2a,b", "image_url": "http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/1931-55-2a,b-ov.jpg", "dimension": "7 x 3 7/8 inches (17.8 x 9.9 cm)"}, {"origin": "Made in Zanesville, Ohio, United States, North and Central America", "credit_line": "Gift of Jay A. and Emma Lewis, 2008", "birth_and_death_years": "Ohio", "audio_url": "", "nationality": "Zanesville", "tags": "", "Label_on_page": "", "category": "American Art", "dates": "19th century", "name": "American Encaustic Tiling Company", "title": "Tile with Bust of Abraham Lincoln", "technique": "Earthenware", "ac_id": "2008-25-69a,b", "image_url": "http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/2008-25-69a,b-pma.jpg", "dimension": "Height: 7 5/8 inches (19.4 cm)"}, {"origin": "Made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, North and Central America", "credit_line": "Gift of John T.
