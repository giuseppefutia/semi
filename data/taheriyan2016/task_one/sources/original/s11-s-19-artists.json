He probably joined the Cologne painters'guildbefore leaving for Italy around 1574.After a stay in Venice, von Aachen was soon in Rome, learning from a circle of Northern European artists. He also painted portraits in Florence. Back in Germany by 1587, he began to gain fame for history pictures and psychologically sensitive portraits.In 1592 Emperor Rudolf II of Prague named Von Aachen imperial painterin absentia. Four years later he moved to Prague, serving as painter, art dealer, and diplomat while also completing commissions for clients in Munich and Augsburg. He frequently journeyed abroad on diplomatic missions and to purchase pictures for his insatiable patron. After Rudolf's death in 1612, von Aachen worked for his successor, Emperor Matthias.Von Aachen's Prague paintings reflect Rudolf's desire for sensuality, with smoothly modeled, elongated figures arranged in elegant poses, often including a nude woman seen from behind. His style combined an idealization indebted to Roman and Florentine Mannerism with brilliant Venetian color and Dutch realism. The many engravings published after his designs spread von Aachen's influence.", "occupation": "Painter"},

She learned photography in the 1920s in Paris, as a studio assistant of fellow American expatriate Man Ray. She soon opened her own portrait studio, where she photographed artists and intellectuals living in Paris, including James Joyce and Eug\u00e8ne Atget. After Atget's death, Abbott was instrumental in promoting his work by preserving his prints and negatives and arranging for publications and exhibitions of his photographs.

May 8,  1937 Orange, New Jersey", "long_biography": "Robert Adams has photographed the landscape of the American West for more than forty years, particularly in California, Colorado and Oregon. His vision is inspired by his joy in nature's inherent beauty, yet tempered by his dismay at its exploitation and degradation. Adams uses photography to express his love for the landscape and to understand how urban and industrial growth have changed it, all the while insisting that beauty in the world has not been entirely eclipsed.Adams was born in New Jersey in 1937 and raised in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. He moved to Southern California in 1956 to attend the University of Redlands. He chose to major in English literature and went on to earn a Ph.D. in that subject at the University of Southern California in 1965.When Adams returned to Colorado to begin what he anticipated would be a career in teaching, he was dismayed by the changes he saw in the landscape. He bought a 35-mm camera, taught himself the fundamentals of photography, and began making pictures infused with a love for the geography of his home state.Adams's visual education came in part through the work of photographers who had preceded him in the West a century before, especially those of Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson, and Carleton Watkins. Their work, together with that of Lewis Hine, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, and Ansel Adams--who often merged their social concerns with aesthetic ones--helped inspire Adams's style: a spare formalism coupled with emotional depth.Since the 1970s, more than twenty-five books of Adams's photographs have been published, as well as two collections of essays,Beauty in Photography: Essays in Defense of Traditional Values(1989) andWhy People Photograph(1994).", "occupation": "photographer"},
{"artist_name": "Robert Adams", "nationality": "British", "birth_data_and_place": "b.  1917 Far Cotton, Northamptonshire, d.   1984 Great Maplestead, Essex", "long_biography": "In the years following World War II, Robert Adams was among a handful of English sculptors who fully embraced three-dimensional abstraction. Unlike Henry Moore or Barbara Hepworth, whose work always related to the human figure or natural landscape, Adams freed his forms from the world around him and explored the pure interplay of angular and circular objects in space.In the 1930s and early 1940s, Adams supported himself with a variety of jobs and was only able to study art intermittently. But after World War II, during which he served as an engineer, he was able to commit to a career as a sculptor. At the age of thirty in 1947, Adams held his first one-man show. Under the influence of Henry Moore, he showed wood, plaster, and stone forms abstracted from the natural world. Trips to Europe and America over the next few years exposed Adams to a range of influences and he broke away from his English contemporaries to create increasingly abstract forms. In Paris, Adams befriended Constantin Brancusi and studied work by Pablo Picasso and Kazimir Malevich. In New York, Adams met a number of American artists including Alexander Calder.Much of Adams' early work was carved wood or stone. But in the mid-1950s, after learning to weld, he increasingly turned to iron, bronze, and, for large architectural reliefs, poured concrete. During the 1960s, he worked primarily with welded steel sheets. Sometimes these forms were pierced allowing light to shine through. Now one of Britain's preeminent abstract sculptors, Adams received commissions for large works across Europe and America. He suddenly abandoned welded steel at the end of the 1960s and returned to carving. Many of his later sculptures are modest bronzes from carved wood patterns, although he did continue to create some large pieces in stainless steel.", "occupation": "sculptor; designer"},

The Society was an eclectic group of intellectuals with a wide variety of interests; at its meetings, Adamson learned of the invention of photography from Sir David Brewster. Brewster, the newly appointed principal of the St. Andrews colleges, had learned about photography through correspondence with one of its inventors, William Henry Fox Talbot. Some of the first photographs made in England were exhibited at the Society's meetings.Adamson primarily made portraits and views of the countryside near his home; he was known fornaturalistic, lively renderings of his subjects.

His surviving vases suggest that he specialized in the decoration of large vessels. His work marks the transition from theArchaicto theClassicalstyle in Greek vase-painting. The Aegisthus Painter's fondness for crowded, multi-figured scenes carried over from the Archaic period, yet aspects of his drawing style, like the nose that forms a straight line with the forehead and the heavy chins, were characteristic of the new Classical style.

At a time when Athenian vase-painters stressed thenarrativecontent of their work, the Affecter appeared uninterested and focused on the purely decorative aspects.

The count recognized the growing taste for a French style in the decorative arts and hired artisans from the renowned Moustiers Manufactories in southern France. Many early Alcora designs were based on the work of French artists, including Jacques Callot and Jean B\u00e9rain.Alcora specialized intin-glazedearthenware (faience) and produced tableware, plaques,medallions, figures, and portraitbusts. Supported and protected by the Bourbon monarchy, Alcora expanded rapidly and its ceramics were exported to France, Italy, Portugal, and the Americas. When the count died in 1742, the factory was passed to his son, Pedro Pablo, Xim\u00e9nez de Urrea, Abarca de Bol\u00e9a. Under Pedro Pablo's leadership, the factory produced exuberant and colorfulRococovessels and began making creamware (made of pipe clay) andsoft-paste porcelain.

Most of his career however, was devoted to making engravings of mythological and Biblical subjects such as theTwelve Labors ofHerculesand the Story of Adam and Eve.Stylistically Aldegrever's work reflects the influence of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, whose work was widely known throughout Europe and whose monogram Aldegrever imitated. Unlike D\u00fcrer and his followers who specialized in intricate line work, Aldegrever specialized in optical effects of light and shadow. Slim, elongated figures and agitated drapery further distinguish his work.

Exposure to the classically tempered realism of the Carracci school underpinned Algardi's style, which embodied both classicism and the High Baroque.After carving ivory and modeling figures and ornaments for Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua, Algardi settled in Rome by 1625. For ten years, he restored ancient sculpture while becoming known for portrait busts that captured both inward character and details of appearance. In Rome, his constant interaction with ancient classical statuary influenced his own sculpture.Unlike most contemporary sculptors, Algardi was an accomplished draftsman and also worked as an architect. Association with artists such as Domenichino, Nicolas Poussin, and Pietro da Cortona greatly affected his draftsmanship. His surviving drawings primarily relate to his sculptural projects or designs for engravings.Algardi received his first major sculptural commission at age forty, the tomb of Pope Leo XI. His large, influential workshop included Domenico Guidi, Ercole Ferrata, Michel Anguier, and Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi. Copies of Algardi's sculptures spread throughout Europe, inspiring such artists as Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon.", "occupation": "draftsman; sculptor; architect"},

In his landscapes, Alsloot drew inspiration from the forest of Soignes near Brussels. Landscape painting of the late 1500s and the wooded landscapes of Gillis van Coninxloo also influenced his work. Alsloot's own style displayed a refined handling of foliage with a tendency to include views of castles andabbeysfrom the forest of Soignes.

Unlike most of his German contemporaries, he painted few portraits, preferring to focus on the virgin forest or to use it as a setting for both secular and religious subjects.

The cup depicting the ThebanSphinxin the Getty Museum now provides evidence that one individual made all these vases. This cup combines a kalos inscription praising the beautiful youth Kleomelos--which had been the defining feature of the \"Kleomelos Painter\"--with stylistic features found on the signed cups of Apollodoros, such as mannered proportions and pose, extremely slender elongated fingers, and small, deep-set eyes.", "occupation": "vase-painter"},

Settling in New York, he trained as a sculptor at several art schools, while also working as a housepainter, machinist, and dressmaker.In the 1920s, Baizerman began shaping copper by hand. He would forcefully hammer both sides of a cold copper sheet until a cocoon-like image appeared in relief. This arduous process allowed Baizerman to align his artistic practice with the daily toil of the manual laborer to whom he remained profoundly sympathetic. In addition to producing copper pieces, Baizerman created an ambitious series of small-scale statuettes in bronze and plaster as an homage to the urban worker. He pursued \"The City and the People\" throughout his life; at his death, the series featured more than fifty pieces--from the \"Crippled Sharpener\" to the \"Drunk Sailor.\" A second ongoing project, the \"Labor\" series, equally expressed Baizerman's political commitment and solidarity with the working-class.As Baizerman gained in prominence, he created larger copper pieces intended for the outdoors.

He probably trained with Venetian master Gentile Bellini. His earliest dated painting, aVirgin and Child,also shows the influence of Giovanni Bellini's paintings of that subject. In his early career Bartolomeo frequently copied and signed religious works by other painters from northeastern Italy such as the Bellinis.Bartolomeo worked at the Este court in Ferrara from 1505 to 1508, where he developed his style in the rich culture of theRenaissancecourt there. By 1520 he was a successful portrait painter in Milan, depicting fashionable young men in contemporary costume.

By 1534 he had found his direction in the art of nearby Venice, learning as much from thechiaroscuroand luxurious color of Titian's works as from his teachers. He always stayed abreast of developments in Venetian painting, sometimes borrowing details from Lorenzo Lotto's works in his portraits. Engravings were critical in forming Jacopo's style, particularly those by and after artists like Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Raphael, and Parmigianino. Local taste required that art illustrate reality, and Jacopo drew inspiration from the simple human scenes, farm life, and changing aspects of nature he observed in his hometown. To Mannerism's energy, extreme movement, and tightly compressed space, he added realism and earthiness. A humble and subtle observer, his sitters may seem unaware of his presence.

His father Jacopo headed a successful workshop where Giovanni and his brother Gentile painted until about 1470. The precisely organized, linear style of brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna was an early influence as well. Around 1475 the Sicilian Antonello da Messina brought oil painting to Venice, and Giovanni soon switched to the new technique. His vision remained contemplative and poetic, but his style became warmer and more luminous. Giovanni showed that landscape could establish mood rather than just acting as a backdrop, and he integrated figures harmoniously into his landscapes.Giovanni's large workshop producedaltarpieces, devotional works, and sensitive, compelling portraits, as well as highly influential half-length Madonnas. Through his workshop's activity, Giovanni directly or indirectly influenced the Venetian painters of his and the next generation, including Sebastiano del Piombo, Lorenzo Lotto, and Vittore Carpaccio.

Bertin's paintings are firmly rooted in the Neoclassical school of painting, characterized by tight compositions and smooth brushwork, as well as mythological or antique subjects. But Bertin was also an early proponent of sketching outdoors--a practice of direct observation in order to replicate nature in studio-made paintings of imagined, idealized scenes. Bertin encouraged the practice ofplein airto his students, and it later it became a respected genre in its own right.Bertin attended the Royal Academy of Painting in Paris, initially as a student of history painting, the most highly regarded genre in a rigidly structured, academic salon system. For three years he studied with history painter Gabriel-Fran\u00e7ois Doyen. By 1788, he discovered an interest in landscape painting and entered the studio of Neoclassical painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes. Valenciennes devised a new category, thepaysage historique, which infused landscape painting with an idealized, heroic view of history in order to bolster respect for the lowly genre. Bertin embraced it throughout his career.Plein airpainting in Italy was a longstanding tradition for aspiring landscape painters. Bertin made scenes of precisely identified Italian locations, suggesting that he may have visited between 1806 and 1808. He painted outdoors in the Ile-de-France region near his home in Paris.

The painters of this group were particularly interested in depicting emotion and frequently rendered the faces of their subjects in three-quarter view, rather than in profile, which made it easier to convey facial expressions.

He believed that the arts offered insights into the metaphysical world and could potentially redeem a humanity fallen into materialism and doubt. His belief that imagination is the artist's critical filter indicated the dawn of Romanticism, but his peers failed to recognize his genius until his later years. A hosiery salesman's son, Blake trained by attending drawing school in London in 1767, apprenticing to an engraver, and enrolling in the Royal Academy's school in 1779. During the 1780s Blake worked as a commercial engraver and publishing his poems at home. With his wife's assistance, he printed the combined illustration and text from one plate and colored the illustrations by hand or printed the colors over the black outlines. He also bound and sold his own volumes, includingSongs of Innocenceof 1788 and its sequel,Songs of Experienceof 1794. Blake worked in pen, watercolor, and a kind of tempera but rejected oil painting.In the 1820s, he became the center of a group of younger English artists who shared his religious seriousness, including Samuel Palmer. One of these artists commissioned him to create two series of large watercolors, one inspired by the Book of Job and one by Dante'sDivine Comedy.", "occupation": "Draftsman; Printmaker; Painter; Poet"},

Except for a short period in Amsterdam, he lived in Utrecht, becoming so important that Peter Paul Rubens visited him in 1627. Around 1600, landscape became increasingly vital to his art; over time, the subject matter of these landscapes became incidental, even difficult to find. Bloemaert's landscapes incorporated Mannerism's restless light effects and strong contrasts, richly coloredpalette, and lots of movement and detail. Fran\u00e7ois Boucher later recognized a kindred spirit, incorporating many of Bloemaert'smotifsin his painting.In the 1620s Bloemaert's pupil Gerrit van Honthorst imported Caravaggio's ideas to Utrecht from Italy. Bloemaert developed a decorative synthesis of Caravaggio's contrasting light effects and Mannerism's bright, acid colors. Always open to fresh ideas, Bloemaert depicted mythological and religious subjects completely new to Dutch art, designed tapestries, stained-glass windows, and made over 1,500 drawings. In 1611 he co-founded Utrecht'sGuildofSaint Luke.

Blumberg first gained attention for his seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral(1973). In those images, he emphasized the starkly lit shapes of Roman Catholic worshippers as they stood or walked out of the cathedral's cavernous entrance on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Blumberg was inspired by the untrained vision of young gang members he had taught while volunteering for an urban anti-poverty program. Blumberg later said of their pictures: \"Images were often fragmented, hands and heads truncated by the frame's edge. Figures floated upside down and obliquely, without regard to traditional horizontal-vertical relationships and perspective.\"Blumberg initially trained as a scientist, earning degrees in biology from Cornell University in 1959 and the University of Colorado in 1961. A trip to Europe during graduate school changed the course of his life. Heady from experiencing works of art such as J. W. M. Turner's seascapes in London and Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna, he completed his degree, and then moved to New York City, where he initially sought out his subject matter in the streets. His work became increasingly conceptual, exploring principles that are intrinsic to the medium of black and white photography, specifically the relationship of figure to background, the tension between two-dimensional representation and three-dimensional reality, and the possibilities presented by the gray scale inherent to black-and-white photography.In the mid-1960s, Blumberg's photographs were featured in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. In 1965, Blumberg began a long career teaching photography in university art programs, which in turn inspired his own work as he considered the relationship between formal learning and art making. He taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1965-81) and the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles (1981-90).

Early in his career he added staffage, flowers, and animals to other artists' paintings; later on, he painted figures for them as well. In the 1630s he contributed figures to Frans Snyders's paintings; in turn, Snyders added still life elements to Boeckhorst's works. After Rubens's death in 1640, Boeckhorst finished and touched up some of his master's paintings. Until about 1650, Boeckhorst's figure types and compositions closely follow Rubens's late work; after that Anthony Van Dyck's influence can be felt.

The Getty Museum's herm so closely resembles the one in Tunis, both stylistically and technically, that it too must have been made in Boethos's workshop.The two similar herms, one signed and one unsigned, raise questions about the role of the artist and the organization of workshops in ancient Greece. In bronze casting, numerous versions of a work can be produced from the same mold, making the precise role of the artist signing the work unclear.

With Cornelis van Poelenburgh, whose early style is very similar, Breenbergh helped to bring the Italianate tradition of landscape to the Low Countries, reflecting a fascination on the part of northern European artists with Italian landscapes rather than with the local topography.In Holland by 1633, Breenbergh specialized in scenes including Roman ruins, based on his drawings of Italy. In the 1630s he began introducing biblical and mythological figures and his compositions became larger and more ambitious. Breenbergh often painted Old Testament themes, but he placed the scenes themselves far in his landscape's background. His expressive figure types reveal affinities with those of Pieter Lastman.

Bronzino expressed the material world in his portraits; the enameled colors and attention to depicting details like his sitters' lace collars, hair, and jewelry, and even the veins in their hands gave his portraits a remote decorativeness.As court painter to Cosimo I de'Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, Bronzino also painted religious works, which he approached with the same cool detachment as his portraits.

Taken at the precise moment that the soldier was shot dead and falling backward, it conveys a sense of bravery on the part of the soldier, but also lets viewers understand that Capa was himself in harm's way. Capa's bravado led him to wade into the Atlantic Ocean off of Normandy, France along with D-Day troops in World War II. Under a hail of bullets from the German troops above the shore, Capa shot dozens of images from theperspectiveof the American invasion force. In a famous incident, much of Capa's film from that day was ruined when a lab technician placed the film in an overheated dryer, melting the emulsion.In 1947, Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Vandivert, and several other photographers formed the cooperative photo agency, Magnum.

When he completed the cycle in 1498, Venetians delighted in the pageantlike scenes of familiar sights: dogs and pet monkeys, lounging cavaliers, flying flags, and bustling activity everywhere. A native of Venice, Carpaccio was born into a family of fishermen and boat builders. He was probably a student of Gentile Bellini, a Venetian painter of incident-fillednarratives, and assistant to Gentile's brother Giovanni, but Carpaccio ultimately developed his own fanciful storytelling style. Though he painted religious works and secular panel paintings, his main vocation comprised huge, narrative canvases for the Venetianscuole,whose tastes for richly colored panoramas celebrating the city's success perfectly matched his talents.

What is clear is his style: a characteristic, lifelong synthesis of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael's art. Equally apparent is this itinerant painter's importance: he spread the new artistic ideas of the HighRenaissance, transmitting elements of Raphael's style to northern Italy and aspects of Leonardo to Italy's southern regions.Cesare was originally from Lombardy; little is known about his education. As early as 1506, he may have been in Rome, working with Baldassare Peruzzi and probably coming into contact with the young Raphael. After his years in Rome, Cesare probably spent time in Milan. His paintings from this period display his characteristic marriage of Leonardo's means of expression and theme with Raphael's articulation of human form.By 1514 Cesare had left Milan, traveling south, probably through Rome, Florence, and Siena, then settling in Naples and Messina. There his paintings influenced local artists learning the High Renaissance style.

The prince was only one of several aristocrats who established factories in France and Germany in the eighteenth century, searching for the elusive recipe for true porcelain like that produced in China and Japan. The factory's early production consisted of pieces painted in imitation of Japanese ceramics, probably copied directly from the prince's substantial collection. Other designs adapted simplified Eastern motifs, often inaccurately, to create brightly colored, richly patterned works.Chantilly's early works were made from soft-paste porcelain covered with an opaque tin glaze that produced a lustrous background for the painted decoration in enamel colors. The manufactory specialized in delicately modeled jugs, tureens, plates, teapots, and cups and saucers shaped like leaves. They also produced more fanciful designs, such as bald smiling Chinese figures, sometimes squatting beside vases that serve as potpourri or perfume burners.

Living away from the South enables him to respond viscerally--through paintings, drawings, sculpture, and photography--to sites of deep meaning for him. Although Christenberry has long worked in a variety of media, he became known in the early 1970s as a pioneer of fine art color photography, somewhat ironically through small, straightforward snapshots of his subjects. In recent decades, Christenberry's art has consisted of large-format photographs of the same vernacular structures, as well as sculptures that resemble architectural models but are influenced by memory and association more than exacting observation. A large body of his work focuses on the Klu Klux Klan, a part of southern culture he abhors but feels cannot be ignored.Christenberry grew up in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but each summer stayed on the farms of his grandparents in rural Hale County. In the late 1950s, he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. The initial color photographs he made--with a Brownie camera he received as a child--were made as visual reference for the subjects he wanted to paint. In 1960, he had a life-changing experience: he encountered the bookLet Us Now Praise Famous Menand realized that his grandparents had known the poor sharecropper families whose lives were documented in it. Initially inspired by James Agee's writing and Walker Evans's portraits, Christenberry sought out Evans in New York City in 1961.

He rejected hisclassicizingacademic training and developed his own dramatically individualistic style, incorporating the tenets ofhumanismand the technique ofchiaroscuro. Still, Crespi's style owes a debt to the work of the Bolognese painters Lodovico Carracci and Guercino. By 1690 he had traveled to Venice, where he experienced richly colored Venetian painting, and to Parma, where he studied Correggio'sfrescoes. Above all, Crespi's work reflects his sincerity, tenderness, and keen observation of nature, transformed by startling light effects and thick, fluid application of paint. Typically, artists in the 1700s used mainly muted,pastelcolors. However, like Alessandro Magnasco, Crespi chose dark shadows contrasted with strong lights. Crespi's religious and historical subjects were often painted in a direct and intimate manner that betrays his love ofgenre scenes. Few artists had ever portrayed the grime and squalor of contemporary reality without resorting to satire.In 1700 Crespi opened a school in Bologna, where he influenced his Venetian pupils most; they continued to explore his interest in the effects of light and genre scenes.

As the leading Florentine painter of his generation, Daddi helped to ensure that this idea, which heralded the Renaissance and came to be taken for granted until the modern age, was kept alive. For hundreds of years, Italian painting had been based on the abstractions of Byzantine art, which stressed patterning, flatness, and ethereal-looking people. Daddi's figures, like Giotto's, have bulk and physicality. As in everyday experience, their form is modeled by light that is earthly and real. Still, throughout his career, Daddi retained some elements of Byzantium's legacy of abstraction, choosing its almond-shaped eyes, ornamental patterning, and gold backgrounds.Like many in Florence's post-Giotto generation, Daddi later was probably influenced by Sienese art, with its gracefulness and tender human relationships. Ivory carvings from France also may have contributed to the lyric sweetness of his art. He rarely painted frescoes. His large workshop specialized in small, devotional panels, which retain a sense of intimacy even when intended for public places. Daddi is recorded as being artistically active between 1312 and 1347, and scholars estimate that he died soon after.", "occupation": "painter"},

In 1822 Delacroix took the Salon by storm. Although the French artistic establishment considered him a wild man and a rebel, the French government, bought his paintings and commissioned murals throughout Paris. Though Delacroix aimed to balance classicism and Romanticism, his art centered on a revolutionary idea born with the Romantics: that art should be created out of sincerity, that it should express the artist's true feelings and convictions. Educated firmly in the classics, Delacroix often depicted mythological subjects, themes encouraged by the reigning Neoclassical artists at the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. But Delacroix's brilliant colors and passionate brushwork frightened them; their watchwords were \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur.\" They barred him from academy membership until 1857, and even then he was prohibited from teaching in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts.

He studied philosophy and fine arts at San Francisco City College and the University of California at both Santa Barbara and Berkeley. During these studies, he took an interest in art, especially sculpture. In 1957 he moved to New York. His earliest exhibited works were in plaster, wax, and wood.Di Suvero's use of steel developed out of necessity. In 1960, he was crushed  by a freight elevator. Following this serious accident, wood proved difficult to manipulate by hand. In essence, di Suvero used heavy machinery to \"draw\" in steel, making and erasing gestures on a vast scale.

He earned a BA from California State University, Northridge in 1971 and an MA from University of California, Los Angeles in 1973. In college, the new art movements that inspired him--Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Earthworks--were often not easily accessible, but encountered through photographic documentation. \"I came to the conclusion that [photography] was the primary arena of contemporary art,\" Divola has said, \"and that all painting and sculpture and performance was, from a practical point of view, made to be photographed, to be re-contextualized, and talked or written about.\" After earning an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1974, Divola developed his own combination of performance art, sculpture, and installation, with photography at its conceptual core.One of Divola's earliest projects,Zuma(1979), brought him critical acclaim.Zumais a photographic record made over time of a beachfront property that was being used intermittently by the fire department for fire-fighting practice. As Divola observed the building over the course of two years, it was ravaged by fire, vandalism, and the artist's own graffiti. These acts of human \"intervention,\" as he saw them, became integrated with the inevitable natural processes of decay.Isolated Houses, Divola's vivid color photographs of one-room dwellings in the desert area around Twentynine Palms, California, emerged out of his longstanding interest in the Southern California landscape. At the center of each square image is a square house-sometimes shown close up, other times, at a distance. The physical relationship between each man-made structure and its immediate surroundings blur visual distinctions between what is natural and what is artificial.

According to Baldinucci, Dolci's final decline was triggered by Luca Giordano's 1682 visit to Florence. Luca joked that his own rapid style had brought him a fortune, but Dolci would starve if he kept taking so long. Already suffering from depression, Dolci plunged deeper into despair.Dolci's artistic training began at age nine in Jacopo Vignali's studio, where he learned to combine Vignali's emotive approach with the elegant design and bright local color of the Florentine style. Dolci probably also studied Netherlandish painting. Intensely religious, Dolci stated his \"firm intention to paint only works that would inspire the fruits of Christian piety in those who saw them.\" He specialized in devotional works, although he also earned his international reputation through the portraits and still lifes he intended for his sophisticatedpatrons. Dolci captured detail in lavish textiles, jewelry, and the face and hands.

When a friend encouraged him to accommodate others' taste, he replied, \"I work for myself alone and for the perfection of Art.\" Domenichino's sensibility, subtle composition, and delicate color heavily influenced Nicolas Poussin. The mostclassicalBolognese painter of his era, Domenichino sought the ideal form and grandeur known asdisegno.After studying with a Flemish artist, Domenichino switched to the Carracci academy's classical instruction, then assisted Lodovico Carracci. In 1602 he joined Annibale Carracci and his classmates Guido Reni and Lanfranco, his detested rival, working on the Farnese Palace's ceiling murals. Domenichino painted many of the landscapes, ordering and improving on nature. By 1614 he was Rome's leading painter. He also made easel pictures, sometimes painting on copper to achieve a polished finish. In 1621 he began working as architect for PopeGregory XV, creatingfrescoeswith a more emotional Baroque style.In 1631, with his popularity in Rome waning, Domenichino traveled to Naples to take over Guido Reni's commission to decorate a chapel in the Naples Cathedral. This was a potentially dangerous project: other non-Neapolitan artists had refused or abandoned this commission after jealous local artists threatened their lives and killed a servant of Reni's. In 1641 Domenichino died with the project unfinished, and Lanfranco succeeded him.", "occupation": "Draftsman"},

He was the second of three sons in a wealthy, musically talented family, and began drawing caricatures of others at a young age. While his mother was immediately convinced of the young Dor\u00e9's talent, his father, an engineer, pushed the boy to pursue a more practical education. While on a trip to Paris at age fifteen, he was impressed by the shop of Auber and Philipon, established publishers of caricatures and comic magazines. Calling upon his formidable charm and self-confidence, the boy drew his own versions of the shop's work, presented them to the publisher himself when his parents were otherwise occupied, and landed a three-year contract to work in Paris. So began his largely self-taught career as an illustrator. He also worked as a painter and sculptor, though to his dismay, never with the same acclaim.Dor\u00e9's father died of pleurisy when the young man was seventeen, which, along with his mother's continuing faith in his abilities (or what some consider her social climbing and greed), pushed Dor\u00e9 to find commercial success as an artist and to support the entire family. He was prolific, and created not just the illustrations to the classics for which he is most known, but also illustrations for novels, comic books, and other journalism. His work ethic, good looks, and personality gained him acceptance into high society, including an audience with the Empress Eugenie. Many notable artists, writers, and musicians were his friends, including Rossini, Dumas, and Nadar (who also photographed him). He never married.Dramatic, chiaroscuro illustrations of the Bible and literary giants such as Rabelais, Balzac, Cervantes, Dante, and Milton made Dor\u00e9's name. He had a particular gift for illustrating nature and fairy tales. An enthusiastic traveler, in his later career he spent much time in England, where he illustrated Tennyson and others, and opened his own successful Dor\u00e9 Gallery. Among his numerous projects,The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, published in England 1875, dates to his later, darker years. He considered it one of his \"best and most original\" works.

Douris primarily decoratedred-figurecups, but he also painted a few vessels of other forms and in other techniques, including white-ground. His scenes are about evenly divided between mythology and depictions of everyday life.

An early influence was Walker Evans's seminal bookAmerican Photographs(1938). Dow recalls the appeal of Evans's \"razor sharp, infinitely detailed, small images of town architecture and people. What stood out was a palpable feeling of loss...pictures that seemingly read like paragraphs, even chapters in one long, complex, rich narrative.\" Soon after graduate school Dow had the opportunity to work with Evans. He was hired to print his mentor's photographs for a 1972 Museum of Modern Art retrospective.Dow has taught photography at Harvard, Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and his work has been widely exhibited. Among his series isCorner Shops of Britain(1995), which features facades of small family-run businesses: vitrine-like shop windows showcase goods from candy jars to jellied eels.

For nearly twenty-five years, Du Paquier was the only rival of Meissen, the first European porcelain manufactory to discover the recipe of Chinese porcelain.Impressed at the success of Meissen, the entrepreneurial Du Paquier, a minor court official in Vienna, decided to capitalize on its financial success. After experimenting on his own, he brought Christoph Hunger, an enamel decorator, to Vienna for assistance. In 1718 Emperor Charles VI rewarded Du Paquier by giving him an exclusive patent to manufacture \"All sorts of fine porcelain...such as are made in East India and other foreign countries, with far more beautiful colors, decoration, and forms with the help of local workmen and materials.\"In need of more help, Du Paquier lured two more important employees from his rival Meissen, including a kilnmaster who knew the exact combination of ingredients needed to make porcelain. The factory's wares soon achieved fame for their rich decoration, which included European landscapes, hunting scenes, classical mythology, and naturalistic flowers.

The son of a goldsmith, Van den Eeckhout probably studied with Rembrandt in the latter half of the 1630s. The compositional principles of Rembrandt's teacher Pieter Lastman, known for his theatrical realism and illusionism, also strongly affected him. Rembrandt may have encouraged Van den Eeckhout to study Lastman's technique, for Rembrandt owned a number of his master's works.Van den Eeckhout adapted his style according to the genre in which he was working. Throughout his career, hishistory paintingsreflected Rembrandt's style in their broad execution,chiaroscuroeffects, and narrative qualities. His detailedgenre scenes, which he began depicting in the 1650s, anticipate works by Pieter de Hooch. Like so many of his Dutch contemporaries, Van den Eeckhout's portraits reflect the impact of Flemish prototypes and are painted in a more elegant, lighter style than his history paintings. Van den Eeckhout frequently included portraits in historical scenes, a genre calledportraits-histoir\u00e9s.

After discovering photography in the early 1960s, he abandoned a traditional education and instead learned from photographically illustrated books by Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Robert Frank. Although he began his career making black-and-white images, he soon abandoned them to experiment with color technology to record experiences in more sensual and accurate terms at a time when color photography was largely confined to commercial advertising. In 1976 with the support of John Szarkowski, the influential photography historian, critic, and curator, Eggleston mounted \"Color Photographs\" a now famous exhibition of his work at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.William Eggleston's Guide, in which Szarkowski called Eggleston's photographs \"perfect,\" accompanied this groundbreaking one-person show that established his reputation as a pioneer of color photography.

From 1568 to 1577, El Greco lived in Venice and Rome, where Titian's broad brushwork and bright colors, Tintoretto's sweeping movement, and Michelangelo's monumental figures reshaped his Byzantine heritage without replacing it.According to tales, when Pope Pius proposed covering Michelangelo'sLast Judgmentnudes, El Greco alienated many by offering to paint another mural, equally good, if they demolished Michelangelo's. He soon left for Spain. Failing to win favor at the Madrid court, he settled in Toledo, Spain's cultural and religious center. There he developed his trademark style-elongated figures, ecstatically free brushwork, expressive lighting, and acid color-a manner so personal that his assistants never attempted to follow his example.Acclaimed for his penetrating portraits, El Greco also received ecclesiastical commissions throughout Spain, including designing altarpieces.

He studied photography specifically to impress the people of Madagascar, an island off the southeast coast of Africa that had long resisted Christian influence. Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, he made numerous portraits of the Malagasy that reflect his genuine interest in the people he served spiritually.Born to a poor family, Ellis was trained as a gardener, but deep religious feelings prompted him to enlist as a foreign missionary.

In Mantua, Farinati studied Giulio Romano's complex, energeticfrescoesand soon adopted his animated figure types and elaborate, imaginary architecture. He also adopted Paolo Veronese'schiaroscuroand less polished brushwork, and Michelangelo's muscularity, which he had studied in reproductions.Farinati kept a detailed journal from 1573 until his death. In it, he outlined his wide range of projects: painting frames; designing costumes; decorating headboards, doors, horse trappings, and missal covers; and prestigious commissions foraltarpiecesand frescoes in churches and villas. His chiaroscuro drawings on tinted paper are particularly notable; he often used them to plan his paintings, and more than five hundred survive. Very soon after his death, they became collector's items; Sir Peter Lely, an artist and renowned collector in the 1600s, owned many.", "occupation": "Painter; Draftsman; Designer"},

In 1504, like Fra Angelico years before him, Fra Bartolommeo ran the San Marcomonasteryworkshop. He incorporated Leonardo da Vinci's smooth harmonies, spiritual feeling, andsfumatointo his work. To stress the gulf between the divine and the earthly, Bartolommeo was among the first artists to replace contemporary costume with nondescript drapery.

Her father served as an army officer and her family lived near an airfield in the east of England. After the war, Frink attended Guildford School of Art followed by Chelsea School of Art. While still studying at Chelsea, she sold her sculptureBirdto London's Tate Gallery. The bird theme would occupy her over the next two decades. Her earliest birds--often menacing, predatory creatures--powerfully convey post-war fears and fascinations.Beginning in the late 1950s, Frink explored her interest in flight by creating sculptures of winged men and a series of figures crashing down from the sky. In 1964, she began a series of haunting soldiers' heads followed by the celebrated \"Goggle Head\" forms. These menacing male busts, their eyes concealed by sunglasses, portrayed for Frink the brutality of the Algerian war. In the late 1960s, she moved to the south of France. Wild horses in the region inspired many sculptures. On returning to England in 1973, she focused on male nudes with mask-like features and attenuated limbs.Like Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore, Frink built her forms with plaster directly on a metal armature. She would often carve away from the plaster to create a more dynamic surface. The finished form could then be cast in bronze.

What he saw below inspired him to learn how to pilot a plane so he could photograph the American landscape. Garnett's aerial photographs resemble abstract expressionist paintings or views through a microscope. As landscapes, they do not have the conventional grounding of a horizon line. All reveal astonishing patterns that are not seen from the ground.Garnett honed his elegant design sensibility well before earning a pilot's license: Before the war, he attended Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. Later, he headed the Pasadena Police Department's photography lab. In the 1940s and '50s, he began to rack up flying hours around Los Angeles, speaking out about the area's increasing air pollution. He illustrated Nathaniel Owing'sAmerican Aesthetic, a book about land-use practices.During 10,000 hours of flying, Garnett simultaneously piloted a plane while photographing out the window-traveling above every state and many parts of the world. His light 1956 Cessna plane allowed him to fly to just the right location to capture subjects with precision. At first, he experimented with a variety of camera formats and films but found that two 35mm cameras (one loaded with black-and-white film, and another with color film) best suited his needs.Garnett's work defies the stereotype of aerial photography as purely scientific and devoid of artistry. He became the first aerial photographer to earn the prestigious Guggenheim Award.", "occupation": "photographer"},

His lyrical atmosphere, elegant refinement, and attention to detail in rendering landscapes, animals, and costume typify the International Gothic style, originally developed in French and Burgundian courts and used especially inilluminated manuscripts.Gentile's most famous surviving works were made during a short but influential stay in Florence in the 1420s, where he probably encountered the austere realism of his younger contemporary Masaccio.

He designed elaborate fountains for the aristocratic patrons of northern and central Italy, especially for theMedici, who wanted to incorporate large sculptural projects into the landscapes of their Tuscan residences. In addition to large-scale projects, Giambologna also created smaller scale works in bronze. His reputation among contemporaries derived in part from the wide distribution of his works through small-scale bronzes. His large workshop with its many assistants made these small bronzes and continued to reproduce them even after his death. These reproductions were so prized they were often given as diplomatic gifts to foreign envoys, ambassadors, and royalty.", "occupation": "Sculptor"},

Hals trained in Haarlem withFlemishpainter Karel van Mander and was admitted to the painter'sguildthere in 1610. Except for a trip to Antwerp in 1616, Hals never left Holland. Traditionally, portraits had been posed and were prized for restraint, but Hals conveyed the sense of capturing his subjects in the fleeting moment. For earlier painters, drawing was primary; with Hals, paint dominates. No preliminary sketches exist; he probably worked on the canvas using the paint's viscosity and his brushstrokes' shapes to create texture and describe surfaces. Even his rare religious paintings were approached like portraiture.Through the 1620s Hals's pictures were joyous in mood, but during the 1630s his style became increasingly sober. The sympathy and insight of his late work could equal Rembrandt van Rijn's. Hals's workshop was extremely successful, but his finances were a disaster. He died destitute and may have been an alcoholic. Unlike other masters who deliberately developed styles that assistants could copy, Hals's technique could not be followed by an average painter.

He frequently uses his own body as a source and subject. Fabricating most of his own conceptions using do-it-yourself technologies, Hawkinson undermines the preciousness of art while reasserting its virtuosity. In his relatively short but prolific career, he has produced paintings, drawings, photographs, textiles, kinetic sculptures, fountains, rubbings, and assemblages.Each of Hawkinson's singular works employs a medium or mechanical system devised to solve a particular problem or play out a specific idea. A consistent investigative rigor, like that of a scientist, underlies this endless variety, exposing his subjects to measurement, fragmentation, reconfiguration, inversion, wordplay, and a host of other strategies. Within the universe of Hawkinson's art, each small part is a microcosm of the whole and everything is interconnected--the fingertip of a hand miraculously sprouts another hand, a doodle morphs into a map, and the pens used to make it become a sculpture of a severed finger. The result is simultaneously trangressive and transformative, yielding unexpected ways of knowing the world beyond its normal boundaries.Based in Los Angeles, Hawkinson received an MFA degree from the University of California in 1989. In 2006, the Getty Museum commissioned four works by the artist for inclusion in the exhibition,Zoopsia: New Works by Tim Hawkinson, presented in conjunction with the West Coast debut of Hawkinson's\u00dcberorgan, a massive, music-playing sculpture of balloons and horns installed in the Museum Entrance Hall.", "occupation": "photographer; sculptor"},

Heiden produced his ivories for a number of German princes, who both admired his creations and attempted turning themselves. Most of scholars' knowledge of Heiden comes from a small book that he wrote in 1640, dedicated to the duke, which describes one of his ivory objects.

Hepworth often pierced her works, opening them up to light and space, and created sculptures composed of multiple elements. She is best known for her abstract sculptures of stone, wood, and bronze.Raised in Northern England, Hepworth trained at the Leeds School of Art--where Henry Moore was also studying--and at the Royal College of Art in London. Her early works were figurative: animals, birds, and human forms carved in stone or wood. Hepworth began creating abstract shapes in the 1930s, but never abandoned a connection to natural imagery. She frequently interlaced and ornamented her sculpted forms with holes and introduced string, wire, incised lines, and colored paint into her work.In August of 1939, on the eve of World War II, Hepworth and her family moved to Cornwall in southwestern England. She ran a nursery and market garden; at night, in cramped quarters, she made small plaster sculptures. After the war, Hepworth settled in St. Ives, a seaside town, where she lived and worked for the rest of her life. A series of solo exhibitions in the early 1950s raised Hepworth's profile.

His subjects often appear surprised and slightly perturbed, as if caught unaware in private moments of thought or conversation.Following two years of study at East Los Angeles College and two years of service in the United States Army as a medic in the Vietnam War, Hernandez took up photography in earnest around 1970. He walked the streets of his native Los Angeles, observing its inhabitants. In order to work quickly and intuitively, he would pre-focus the camera and then wait for subjects to come into the zone of focus--only briefly bringing the camera to his eye as he walked past them. He repeated this strategy in other cities, including London, Madrid, Saigon, and Washington, D.C. In later decades, Hernandez's photography might seem to have changed dramatically: from black-and-white to color, from wide shots to close ups, from people to places. But Hernandez's interest in urban environments--and cultural differences of class and race implied in them--has not.By the 1980s, Hernadez was working with large format cameras, which necessitated a slower and more deliberate shooting style. His 1979 series,Public Transit Areas, involved using a 5 x 7 inch camera on a tripod, and his subjects seem clearly aware of his presence. Rather than the off-kilter backgrounds of his earlier portraits, streets and buildings recede calmly into deep space. By the 1990s, Hernandez's style shifted again, as he concentrated on color and close-up details. Most of his pictures since the mid-1980s are devoid of human subjects--although their presence is felt. Projects such asLandscapes for the Homeless(1988-91),Waiting for Los Angeles(1996-98), andEverything (The Los Angeles River Basin)(2003-4) documented how the city's human presence has been reduced to the traces and debris left by destructive social forces.", "occupation": "photographer"},

From then until the beginning of World War I, he divided his time between Florence and Munich. Hildebrand'sclassicizingstyle stood in marked contrast to his contemporaries'naturalism. Believing that the sculptor's goal was to allow forms to emerge from the block, he was strongly influenced by Michelangelo. Hildebrand's 1893 essay,Das Problem der Form(The Problem of Form), asserted that truth is revealed in form, with subject matter of relatively minor importance.

Ho\u00fcel was born into a family of prosperous artisans, who sent him to the drawingacademyin Rouen when he was fifteen. At the academy he was exposed to the art of early Dutch andFlemishpainters, which was to have a defining impact on his chosen specialty--landscape painting. In 1758 Ho\u00fcel published a book of landscape engravings, and in 1768 he painted six views of the Duc de Choiseul's property. The following year Ho\u00fcel's influentialpatronssecured a place for him at the French Academy in Rome. Captivated with Italian customs, landscapes, and ancient sites, he traveled throughout southern Italy, makinggouachedrawings that were extolled at ParisSalonsof the early 1770s. He spent the years 1776 to 1779 traveling in Sicily, Lipari, and Malta, after which he published numerous lavishly illustrated travel books based on his journey. Ho\u00fcel's main intention was to illustrate local topography, but his delicate applications of watercolor also magnificently captured the effects of light and atmosphere. In his later years Ho\u00fcel published two illustrated treatises on elephants.

In 1529 Huber became architect for the local count, Graf Nicoluas of Salm, and by 1541 he had become Passau's city architect. Hanns Lautensack was his pupil.Besides religious paintings and numerous half-length and three-quarter-length portraits, Huber designed woodcuts and made landscape drawings.

In France, many artists became fascinated with British history, topography and literature. Although Paul Huet primarily focused on his native French landscape, he was greatly influenced by British landscape painting. Anticipating the innovations of the Barbizon School as well as the Impressionists, Huet sought to capture both the specific features and emotional experience of the natural world.Studying in the studio of Antoine-Jean Gros in the early 1820s, Huet came into contact with the talented English landscape painter Richard Parkes Bonnington. Rather than working indoors under Gros' tutelage, the pair preferred to go out into nature and paint from life. The appearance of near-identical works by the two artists suggests the depth of their artistic friendship. Huet's exposure to John Constable's ambitious landscapes, in particularThe Hay Wain,at the Salon of 1824, propelled him toward a greater truth-to-nature. Like Constable, Huet also began using thick impasto to capture nature's distinct and varied textures and the effects of light. His own landscapes were accepted at the Salon of 1827 and he would exhibit there regularly for more than forty years. In addition to painting, Huet was an especially gifted watercolorist and also produced drawings, pastels, and lithographs.By the 1830s, Huet had established himself as an innovative landscape painter. He traveled frequently, visiting Italy, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, as well as exploring his own native France. On his travels, he worked constantly, often outdoors, in a variety of media, to capture the changing seasons and weather conditions. By the 1850s, with a family to support and increasing ill health, Huet was no longer viewed as a leading landscapist. The Barbizon School painters, who also had been inspired by Constable'sThe Hay Wain,now overshadowed him.", "occupation": "painter; draftsman; printmaker"},

Humble was drafted during the Vietnam War, then became a photojournalist for theWashington Postbefore pursuing a graduate degree at the San Francisco Art Institute. His itinerant nature continued when he traveled the world in the early 1970s, going from Europe to the Middle East, then to Africa and Asia in his Volkswagen van. However, since the summer of 1974 Humble has lived in one place: Los Angeles. His traveling instinct did not diminish despite his fixed geographical location; rather, it intensified as he traversed the length and breadth of the city (from the San Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles to Venice and the shores of Long Beach), creating images that explore the postmodern qualities of America's second largest city. Humble's desire to capture \"the incongruities and ironies of the Los Angeles landscape\" results in a compelling body of work where power lines cut across blue skies, freeways divide neighborhoods and a river bisects the city.Humble began working with a 35mm camera, favoring black-and-white prints, but in September 1979 he bought his first view camera and switched to color printing, producing first Cibachrome, then chromogenic prints. In the 1970s color emerged within the tradition of photography, most notably in the 1976 exhibitionPhotographs by William Egglestonat the Museum of Modern Art in New York. No longer confined to the commercial domain of advertising, color photography gained recognition as a valid expression of fine art.

Husom has cited several influences to his approach to this series, \"Fairgrounds\" (1978-97), including German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, known for their typological studies of industrial structures--such as furnaces and water towers--which they began in the late 1960s. \"Fairgrounds\" similarly focuses on utilitarian constructions within one building type in which the similiarites and variations play off one-another.Husom has produced other photographic series: In 1982 with photographer Ann-Marie Rose, Husom created \"Postcard Journal,\" a photographic and written record of a trip around the world; \"Tokyo 2000\" (2000) visually explores different aspects of Japanese culture, such as the sushi industry, street life, and daily work preparations for the new millennium celebrations; and \"Rivertowns\" (2001-ongoing) looks at the places where communities gather--churches, taverns, town halls--in the Upper Mississippi River valley.Husom earned a B.F.A. and M.F.A. in photography and film from the University of Minnesota in 1970 and 1973 respectively.

Around 1618 he established himself as a portrait painter in London. His signed or monogrammed portraits number several hundred; he is the first English-born painter known to have made so many. Anthony van Dyck's dazzling manner influenced him, but Jansen's style remained more straightforward, a somewhat conservative approach that appealed to hispatronsin the higher, but not the highest, social circles. Typically, he painted bust-length representations with sitters looking directly out of the picture, giving close attention to accurately renderings of clothing. Jansen also paintedminiaturesin oil on copper, some of which were reduced copies of larger paintings.When the English Civil War began in 1643, Jansen moved to the northern Netherlands, where he helped to popularize van Dyck's airy, liquid touch. He stopped first in Middelburg and later in Amsterdam, The Hague, and finally Utrecht. His half-length and three-quarter-length portraits were notable for their elegance and for his characteristically precise rendering of his sitter's features and clothing.", "occupation": "draftsman; painter"},

As a result of this wide variety of subject matter, his works have frequently been attributed to others. Moreover, he signed few paintings, and his style often changed in response to new developments in Dutch painting.De Jongh's training included study with Cornelis Saftleven in Rotterdam, a portraitist in Delft, and aCaravaggesquepainter in Utrecht. Beginning in 1635, de Jongh spent seven years in France.De Jongh's earliest known paintings are portraits and genre subjects dating from his return to Rotterdam around 1642. By the late 1640s, his genre subjects and hunting scenes show the influence of the UtrechtCaravaggisti, especially Jacob Duck.During the 1650s, de Jongh may have been Rotterdam's most prestigious painter. Demonstrating his interest in Dutch painting's latest innovations, his portraiture became more expressive and his space more clearly defined, and he grew more concerned with light. This work greatly influenced the young Pieter de Hooch.After about 1660, de Jongh's artistic output decreased, probably due to his business ventures, his duties as a Rotterdam militia officer, and later, his work asSchout, or sheriff, of Hillegersberg.", "occupation": "Painter"},

He was also a highly accomplished and prolific draftsman. For drawings, Klimt preferred to work in black chalk and pencil, monochrome media which draw attention to the extreme refinement and intensity of his line.The son of an engraver, Klimt entered the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in 1876. His early work, often created in partnership with his brother Ernst and fellow student Franz von Matsch, was academic in character, freely mixing historical styles; it included several important commissions for the decoration of public buildings, such as the newly built Burgtheater. Because of the acclaim these frescoes garnered, the University of Vienna commissioned him in 1894 to paint three murals representing the disciplines of Medicine, Jurisprudence, and Philosophy. However, over the ten years he worked on the paintings, Klimt's style underwent dramatic changes. In 1897, he led a group of nineteen avant-garde artists that broke away from the conservative K\u00fcnstlerhaus (Vienna's main exhibition venue for contemporary art) to form a new movement: the Vienna Secession. The Secession's motto, \"To each age its art, to art its freedom,\" illustrated its aim to create a new art, unbounded by tradition, that reflected modern life. A key influence on the Secession's aesthetic was Symbolism, an international artistic movement of the late nineteenth century that advocated the representation of ideas, dreams and states of mind. This influence manifested itself in Klimt's work in a dreamlike atmosphere, elegant stylization, and an all-pervading eroticism. In fact, the eroticism and graphic nudity of the completed University murals so scandalized the faculty that in 1905, Klimt took them back and returned his payment. He never undertook a public commission again, devoting the rest of his career, up to his death in 1918, to glittering landscapes and portraits of women from Vienna's upper classes.Klimt and the other members of the Secession and the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte--a group of fine and decorative artists with important links to the Secession--believed passionately in the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art), in which several different art forms were combined to unified effect.

There he may have been a pupil of Rembrandt van Rijn, and Koninck's early work shows Rembrandt's influence. Koninck was well-to-do; he owned a shipping company and an inn, and his wife owned a ferry service.By the early 1650s Koninck was painting his distinctive composition, the imaginary Dutch panorama. He rarely depicted a recognizable location. His landscapes are flat, seen from a high viewpoint under an enormous sky, with a river or road winding towards the horizon and patterns of light and dark throughout. Their evocative power of space, light, and shadow is paramount. In the 1660s, Koninck's landscapes evolved into a combination of panoramas and park landscapes populated by pastoral types and elegant folk. After 1676 Koninck, an esteemed member of Amsterdam's middle class, probably stopped painting, though his reputation reached far beyond Dutch borders.

Lit by crisp daylight, La Tour's works from this period are characterized by their still atmosphere and meticulous rendering of ornament and textures.Increasingly, La Tour was drawn to candlelight scenes in which a single flame created an atmosphere of otherworldly calm. He gradually simplified forms until, in his late works, all masses were reduced to simple, almost geometrical, shapes.

The artist's celebration and critique of popular culture made him a central figure of the Pop Art movement.Much of Lichtenstein's early work was abstract, but in 1961 he began borrowing both the subject matter and style of comics and advertisements. To mimic commercial printing techniques, Lichtenstein favored a bold, bright palette. He also used patterns of colored circles to evoke the Benday dots of newspaper images. This imitative technique suggests an impersonal, mechanized approach to painting and drew attention to the banality or clich\u00e9d character of his source material.By the mid-1960s, Lichtenstein did not always base his works on a specific source. He created imaginary landscapes, a series of enlarged \"brushstrokes,\" and applied his comic strip style to iconic work by Pablo Picasso, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and other modern painters. Lichtenstein also made sculpture, their forms often inspired by motifs developed in his paintings. His earliest three-dimensional pieces were made of wood; he later turned to glazed ceramics.

Over subsequent centuries, workshops in the Limoges region became famous for distinctive techniques and styles, as well as for stunning workmanship.The earliest techniques of enameling date to antiquity, and were developed by goldsmiths. Byzantine and Celtic artisans perfected \"cloisonn\u00e9,\" a technique in which tiny strips of metal are attached to a flat surface to form raised walls that hold the molten glass. The overall effect is not unlike stained glass, which also evolved in Europe during the Middle Ages.By the early 1100s, copper became the preferred surface for a technique called champlev\u00e9, in which molten glass is contained in areas incised or etched into the metal surface. During the twelfth-century, Limoges became a highly commercial center for enamel production. Workshops specialized in decorating ecclesiastical objects such as altarpieces, shrines, and reliquaries for use throughout Western Europe. Limoges enamel became renowned for its cool hues of lapis, cobalt, and turquoise, accented by reds, greens, and white.After the sacking of Limoges in 1371 during the Hundred Years War, the craft of enameling nearly died out. The region gradually revived its industry as specific artisan families such as the P\u00e9nicaud, Limousin, and Reymond created distinct styles within the craft. By the early sixteenth-century, Limoges artisans introduced a technique called enamel painting in which multiple layers of molten glass are painted on, and then over-painted with white, to create a subdued color scheme.", "occupation": "enameler; metalworker"},

By representing an interior as a suite of rooms rather than a three-wall, one-room enclosure, Maes had great impact on the Delft painters Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch.About 1660 Maes began specializing in portraits, becoming wildly successful by abandoning his Rembrandtesque style for the bright colors and studied elegance of Flemish artists such as Anthony van Dyck.

For much of his career, Manet's urban subjects and seemingly detached approach to painting produced one scandal after another. He was a profoundly important figure to the development of Impressionism and to the course of art into the twentieth century.Schooled in the traditional studio of history painter Thomas Couture, and a scrupulous student of Italian and Spanish Old Masters, Manet quickly broke away from convention. He painted Paris's fashionable high society and marginalized poor, the spectacle of the boulevard, caf\u00e9, and racetrack. Answering poet and friend Charles Baudelaire's call for art capturing the epic, heroic qualities of modern life, Manet produced large canvases of contemporary subjects; for example, he depicted the city's down-and-out on a scale once reserved for royal portraiture. Manet was equally provocative in his approach to painting, laying down intense contrasts of light and dark, creating brazenly unmodulated paint surfaces, and asserting the primacy of flattened pattern and color. For these innovations, Manet attracted unrelenting hostility and scorn.Particularly shocking to the Parisian public was Manet's treatment of the female nude. In the 1860s, the brazen, frank nudity ofLe d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbeand, most notoriously,Olympia, caused major scandals at the Salon. Manet also sought to revise other traditional genres and created still life paintings, portraiture, and religious scenes. The artist addressed current political events in his paintings and graphic work. Only toward the end of his career--having been warmly embraced by the younger Impressionist painters and their circle--did Manet begin to gain widespread recognition for his achievements.", "occupation": "painter; draftsman"},

His drawings and designs provide a fascinating window onto everyday life in the later Middle Ages.The Master of the Housebook is named after a renowned manuscript, theMedieval Housebook, created in southern Germany around 1475. This lavish volume features pen-and-ink drawings, including some in color, illustrating life in and around a princely court. Widely divergent subjects are featured: images of weapons, allegories of the planets, tournament and hunting scenes, landscapes and castles, and coats of arms. Outside of this manuscript, few drawings by this artist appear to have survived. He is also known as the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet after eighty drypoint etchings in the print room of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. About half of his prints have religious subjects, but the Master of the Housebook also sensitively captured children playing, music making, and amorous young lovers.Only a single painting is widely accepted as by the Master of the Housebook, but several religious scenes are attributed to him. He is also believed to have created many stained-glass windows and played a major role in the emergence of secular subjects, such as courtly love, in stained glass in the late 1400s. His stained-glass designs were copied and adapted for decades and ultimately had an impact on the stained glass of Albrecht D\u00fcrer.", "occupation": "printmaker; draftsman; painter"},

Mengs began to study art seriously at the age of twelve, when he accompanied his father on a trip to Rome.  He remained there for four years making drawings, and then returned to Dresden where he quickly achieved success as a pastel portrait painter.  He masterfully used dry pastel crayons, achieving an unusual degree of color saturation and glossy brilliance that mimicked oil painting. During his second trip to Rome in 1746 Mengs began using oils. By the end of this three-year residence in Italy, Mengs had converted to Catholicism and married a young Roman woman. Aside from time spent working as a court painter in Dresden and in Madrid, Mengs spent the remainder of his life in Italy painting altarpieces, frescoes, and Grand Tour portraits of young English aristocrats, for whom he also acted as an art and antiquities dealer.  He was highly thought of in Rome, where he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca and held a teaching post at the Accademia del Nudo.", "occupation": "Painter"},

They have long prompted critics and scholars to speculate that the artist made them in reaction to an undiagnosed mental illness.Messerschmidt was born in the village of Wiesensteig, in what is now southern Germany. He learned his trade from two uncles, a court sculptor in Munich, and an artist based in Graz, Austria. Later, Messerschmidt attended the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts and assisted at a foundry. His spectacular ability to work in stone and metal soon brought him portrait commissions from imperial and aristocratic clients. Made over the course of a decade, those early works reflect the prevailing late Baroque-Rococo sensibility, which emphasized the decorative. Between 1760 and 1765, Messerschmidt traveled to Rome, Paris, and London. Seeing the work of other sculptors inspired him to shift toward Neoclassicism--a more spare and refined style. At this time, he began to emphasize his sitters' features and character. In 1779, Messerschmidt taught at the Viennese Academy and established his own workshop. Those outward signs of success were short-lived, as colleagues and friends observed changes in his behavior. After failing to gain a professorship of sculpture position at the academy, Messerschmidt left Vienna and returned to Wiesensteig.Messerschmidt likely began his \"character heads\" around 1770, as his mental health apparently deteriorated. He produced the life-sized busts rapidly, 69 within a 13-year period. He may have intended them as physiognomic studies, perhaps inspired by experiments enacted by his friend, the controversial physician Franz Anton Mesmer. Messerschmidt probably also knew of Johann Caspar Lavater, who popularized \"physiognomy\"--the notion that human character is discernable by a person's physical appearance.Collectively, Messerschmidt's \"character heads\" display a range of emotions. Although they are not self-portraits, many resemble the artist. In any case, he never intended to exhibit or sell them. After a short stay with family members in Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), he died alone and in relative poverty.", "occupation": "sculptor"},

The atmosphere of experimentation promoted at the ID left a discernible impression on Metzker's work, from his thesis project documenting downtown Chicago (My Camera and I in the Loop, 1958-59), to his continued engagement with urban scenes in Europe (1960-61) and Philadelphia, where he moved in 1962 upon accepting a teaching position at the Philadelphia College.Around 1964, Metzker grew increasingly uncomfortable with the single image and began to combine multiple images into a single work, experimenting both with adjacent frames of film (Double Frames, 1964-66) and non-adjacent frames (Couplets, 1964-68).  For his most complex works, calledComposites(1964-84), he often incorporated entire rolls of film into grids of photographs that deliver crisp, descriptive passages when viewed up close and intricate, rhythmic patterns of light and dark when viewed from a distance.Over his long career, Metzker has repeatedly, pushed an idea or a technique to the extreme, discovering its limits and its potential.

More than anyone, Michelangelo elevated the status of the artist above the level of craftsman. His deeply felt religious convictions were manifested in his art. For him, the body was the soul's prison. By using movement, monumental forms, and gesture to express spiritual urges, he opened up new artistic vistas in the direction of Mannerism and the Baroque. \r\n\r\nOvercoming parental opposition, Michelangelo apprenticed with Florence's best fresco painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio, while greatly admiring the work of Donatello. He studied classical literature at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent, fostering his Neoplatonist philosophy among the humanists there. After his reputation-making Roman Piet\u00e0 of 1499, he triumphed with his statue of David in Florence, the first nude carved on a colossal scale since antiquity. From 1508 to 1512, he painted the Vatican's Sistine Chapel ceiling single-handedly. It was an immediate triumph, and the artist was recognized as a revolutionary genius. His Sistine Chapel Last Judgment, finished in 1541, broke completely with High Renaissance precepts of spatial depth and perspective to create two thousand square feet of torment and terror. Later, Michelangelo contributed greatly as architect to Saint Peter's basilica in Rome. A relentless draftsman, Michelangelo created profoundly spiritual drawings.

In Rome he received public commissions forfrescoesandaltarpieces, fusing the Roman HighRenaissancegrandeur of Raphael and Michelangelo with the North Italian color of Titian and Guercino. His most characteristic works were idyllic scenes with biblical figures or saints in luxuriant, dramatic landscapes that combine the golden light andpainterlyhandling of Venetian art with figures inspired by Roman High Renaissance masters. Mola was also a versatile draftsman and a wittycaricaturist.In his last years, Mola's fortunes declined rapidly and his paintings became increasingly dramatic.

These artists eliminated the ornamental foliage and glitteringhighlightsof theirManneristpredecessors. Molijn's most innovative period was the 1620s. In depicting the dunes and the flat countryside around Haarlem, he chose not to divide the landscape into separate realms as was common practice. Instead, he subordinated scattered details to large areas of light and shadow and unified the scene by prominent diagonals leading into the distance.During his maturity, Molijn was more active as a draftsman than as a painter.

The human figure, most often female, served as the basis for Moore's exploration of broad themes--from change and metamorphosis to war and conflict.The seventh child of a coal miner, Moore signed up at seventeen for the army in World War I. At the end of the war, he enrolled at Leeds School of Art where he was quickly recognized as a star pupil. From the outset of his career, Moore believed passionately in direct carving: all of his early work in stone or wood was painstakingly carved by hand. His insistence on carving and truth to materials was partly inspired by a deep appreciation for non-Western sculpture; African, Oceanic, and especially Pre-Columbian art captivated the young sculptor. Based in London, Moore associated with other British sculptors including Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.In the 1930s, Moore was a prominent but somewhat controversial avant-garde personality, but after World War II he became internationally known. This newfound success coincided with a shift in both his subject matter and materials. In the post-war period, Moore focused on more traditional, populist imagery, including draped figures and the theme of mother and child. He also strove to create work that was more three-dimensional, that revealed itself from all sides. Finally, Moore largely abandoned direct carving for modelling and began working principally in bronze. This allowed him to increase both the scale and quantity of his work.", "occupation": "sculptor; draftsman; printmaker; photographer"},

His works appeared in the 1860s but they anticipated the Symbolist work of the 1880s, which explored interior consciousness rather than exterior observation. \"I believe neither in what I touch nor what I see. I only believe in what I do not see, and solely in what I feel,\" he wrote.A solitary, wealthy intellectual, Moreau spent his life in Paris, apart from a visit to Italy, where he was impressed by Vittore Carpaccio's work. His early paintings were influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and by the Romantic exoticism of Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau. In his paintings, often of mythological or biblical subjects, a powerful, seductive, evil woman often appears. Moreau painted in rich, jewel-like colors, and his detailed oil paintings have a glistening, impastoed surface. His watercolors, which he boldly exhibited at the Salon, were swiftly painted, some almost abstract.

But Munch's work took on an ever-deepening emphasis on subjectivity and an active rejection of visible reality. The unique and highly personal style he developed to convey mood, emotion, or memory would greatly influence the course of twentieth-century art and in particular, the development of Expressionism.The second of five children, Munch lost both his mother and favorite sister to tuberculosis before his fourteenth birthday. Having abandoned the study of engineering due to frequent illness, Munch decided to become an artist. His early work revealed the influence ofplein-airpainters like Monet and Renoir. In 1889, Munch began to spend long periods in Paris. Exposed to the work of Gauguin and other French Symbolists--both painters and writers--Munch developed a simplified language of bold color and sinuous line to express his view of human suffering. He grappled with dark, unsettling themes like sickness and death, depression and alienation.In the 1890s Munch dedicated himself to an ambitious multi-canvas series calledThe Frieze of Life. Though the series was never completed, the twenty-two canvases Munch did produce extended his obsessive exploration of sexuality and mortality.The Frieze of Lifeincluded Munch's iconic image of modern angst,The Scream; as with many of his paintings, he created several versions of it.

He probably spent some time in Madrid around 1648, where he copied works by artists including Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck.

The Scottish-born doctor was introduced to photography around 1849, while in the Medical Service of the Army of the East India Company. Stationed near the Taj Mahal in Agra, he evidently developed a considerable interest in the Mughal architecture of the region. Throughout the forty-year period that Murray lived and worked in India, he systematically recorded many famous buildings in and around Agra and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.In the mid-1800s, no simple method of enlarging photographs existed. To make a sizable print, Murray worked with a large-format wooden camera capable of accepting negatives up to 16 by 20 inches. He worked with both glass andwaxed-paper negatives; traveling photographers and those in remote places found the waxed-paper negatives particularly useful because the paper did not require immediate development. With this unwieldy equipment, Murray produced a body of work documenting India's architecture that remained unsurpassed in the 1800s.", "occupation": "photographer"},

After a stagecoach accident, he convalesced back home in England and learned photography. Upon returning to the States in 1867, he soon earned his reputation photographing the landscape.Apparently a hot-tempered man, Muybridge shot and killed his much younger wife's lover but was acquitted after a sensational trial, in part perhaps because he was friends with Leland Stanford, railroad magnate and governor of California. They became acquainted in 1872, when Stanford made a bet regarding a horse's gallop, contending that when a horse gallops, at some point all four of its feet are off the ground simultaneously. Stanford hired Muybridge to prove it photographically; Muybridge, using a system of trip-shutter, high-speed photography and twenty-four cameras, did just that. Never one for false modesty, Muybridge declared:The circumstances must have been exceptionally felicitous that made co-laborateurs [sic] of the man that no practical impediment could halt and of the artist who, to keep pace with the demands of the railroad builders, hurried his art to a marvel of perfection that it is fair to believe it would not else have reached in another century.Muybridge is best known for this work and his \"Animal Locomotion\" series of stopped-action motion studies completed in 1887.", "occupation": "photographer"},

In Rome, he assimilated the styles of Michelangelo, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Taddeo Zuccaro. Muziano was best known foraltarpiecesand religious works; his 1555Raising of Lazarusin Rome's Pinacoteca Vaticana earned Michelangelo's praise.

Through such works as his landscapefrescoes, now destroyed, forCardinalIppolito II d'Este's villas in Rome and Tivoli, Muziano helped to revive theclassical, idealized landscape. His landscape style was disseminated by engravings and widely imitated by Northern European artists.

He focused on the psychological elements of photography, aiming to reveal the moral personalities of his sitters rather than make attractive portraits. Bust- or half-length poses, solid backdrops, dramatic lighting, fine sculpturing, and concentration on the face were trademarks of his studio. His use of eight-by-ten-inch glass-plate negatives, which were significantly larger than the popular sizes of daguerreotypes, acccentuated those effects.At one point, a commentator said, \"[a]ll the outstanding figures of [the] era--literary, artistic, dramatic, political, intellectual--have filed through his studio.\" In most instances these subjects were Nadar's friends and acquaintances.

Visiting Rome between 1622 and 1625, he studied paintings by the famousItalian Renaissanceartists. His draftsmanship in particular, with its economical line, graceful curves, and abbreviated forms, shows his exposure to the art of Giovanni Lanfranco. During a trip to Naples in 1630, Novelli saw works by Jusepe de Ribera and Neapolitan naturalist painters, who encouraged him to develop a more realistic and popular art. In return, Novelli's style brought to Ribera and Bernardo Cavallino an awareness of Van Dyck's elegance and rich color.Returning to Sicily in 1637, Novelli painted primarily religious subjects, including canvases andfrescocycles forecclesiasticalinstitutions and also served as the royal architect.", "occupation": "Painter; Draftsman"},

Novelli produced designs for poetry, theater, and literature, moving effortlessly between pen and ink, watercolor, and on occasion, red chalk. His prodigious output as a draftsman reflected both a personal interest in literary culture (Novelli was affiliated with the Venetian Literary Academy) and the burgeoning publishing industry in eighteenth-century Venice. He also produced a remarkable number of preparatory drawings for paintings andaltarpieces.Novelli trained with the Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Pittoni but was equally influenced by Francesco Guardi and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. In 1768, he was accepted as a member of the Accademia in Venice for which he painted anAllegory of the Arts.During the following decade, Novelli produced altarpieces andfrescoesthroughout northern Italy and hispatronsincluded Catherine the Great, empress of Russia.

Absorbing both the techniques and themes of Italy's preeminent Renaissance painter, d'Oggiono appealed to a broad public desiring fashionable \"Leonardesque\" work.The son of a successful goldsmith, d'Oggiono was probably born in Milan between 1465 and 1470. Little is known of his youth, including whom he may have trained with before encountering Leonardo. By 1490, d'Oggiono had met and become in some way associated with Leonardo; their exact working relation is undocumented. Initially, d'Oggiono collaborated on works with several of Leonardo's followers, but by the late 1490s, he had an independent career. He painted church altarpieces as well as more modest works on canvas. Very few of his earlier works have survived, but it is known that he tended to repeat successful subjects again and again.D'Oggiono worked in Venice and Liguria before returning to Milan around 1504. He copied many works by Leonardo including several versions of theVirgin and Child,such as theVirgin of the Rock,and of the Madonna. Many more of his paintings borrowed Leonardesque themes and techniques, such as Leonardo's distinctive use ofsfumato(softened outlines). Among his many commissions, d'Oggiono created a copy of theLast Supperfor a monastery in Milan. The copy was required to resemble Leonardo's original but was surrounded by an elaboratetrompe l'oeil freize. Far removed from Leonardo's original intentions, such a decorative flourish reveals that d'Oggiono was eager to please his patrons.As his career progressed, d'Oggiono's work gradually shed the influence of Leonardo in favor of artists like Perugino and Leonardo's followers, such as Giampietrino.

Instead of spontaneous improvisation, intense colorpalettes, and decorative effects--often in the popularfrescomedium--Piazzetta worked slowly in almost monochromatic oils, creating religious canvases and enigmaticgenrepictures. \"He is a snail,\" said a Swedish visitor.His sculptor father probably introduced Piazzetta to art. Study with Giuseppe Maria Crespi in Bologna likely ignited his fascination with somber, dramatic effects and his interest in genre painting. Piazzetta emulated Crespi by portraying common people. By the 1740s he owned an active studio concentrating on church commissions and genre scenes.Piazzetta's renowned drawings of half-length figures and heads documented the people of Venice. Traditionally, Venetian painters did not consider drawings as independent works of art, but Piazzetta created a new art form, giving drawing a status equal to painting in importance and quality.

Pickenoy painted group portraits as well as individual portraits, particularly pendants of prominent Amsterdammers. The Getty Museum's pair shows Pickenoy at the height of his abilities. After 1640 Pickenoy's popularity apparently began to fade, for only two of his works from this period survive.

After studying in Rome for five years, Pigalle returned to France in 1740 where he conceived the model for his most well known sculpture, a seated statue of Mercury. This graceful and animated rendering was an immediate success. Pigalle was accepted into the Acad\u00e9mie Royale and soon began receiving commissions from Louis XV and his entourage.By the 1750s, Pigalle was able to devote himself almost exclusively to official commissions and produced a number of large-scale, public monuments. Perhaps his most important patron was the king's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, for whom he executed several projects including garden statues and portraits. Pigalle's last major work, a life-size marble sculpture of the philosopher Voltaire, summarized the overriding concerns of his career--truth of form, expression, and gesture. In the 1700s, contemporary men of letters were typically depicted in antique attire, but Pigalle depicted a naked, infirm, and all too human Voltaire.

During that time, his photographs--which are remarkable for their subtlety and vibrancy--encouraged widespread acceptance of color photographs as works of art.Porter was born in Winnetka, Illinois in 1901 to a prosperous family. As a boy he photographed the natural surroundings of his family's summer home, Great Spruce Head Island, Maine. After earning degrees in chemical engineering and medicine, he spent a decade working as a scientist and teacher. The elegant black-and-white landscapes he made at the time reflected the influence of photographers Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, and Ansel Adams. In 1938, Stieglitz gave Porter a solo show at his influential New York art gallery, An American Place. That significant event inspired Porter to make photography his profession. In 1939, he switched to color photographic materials, mastering the delicate multi-step printing techniques. Although Porter often struggled against an opinion that color photographs were not art, his exquisite prints earned him a Guggenheim Fellowship and a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Aside from Porter's exquisite dye transfer prints, he became known for his fine art publications. In the 1960s, he began a long-term collaboration with the Sierra Club to produce books focusing on the preservation of natural resources. His first,In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World(1962), changed notions about what nature photography could be. The second,The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado(1963), spurred federal reclamation of Western rivers, which ultimately led to passage of the Wilderness Act. In his lifetime, Porter produced twenty-five books, including one that he worked on for much of his life,Birds of North America: A Personal Selection(1972).", "occupation": "photographer"},

Potter created portraits of animals, making them his picture's focus, not just a backdrop for human action. The precocious son of a painter, his first dated work is from 1640. He entered Delft'sGuildof Saint Luke in 1646 and later moved to The Hague. He is said to have wandered the Dutch countryside, sketchbook in hand, equally sensitive to how farm animals behave at different times of day and to light's vicissitudes from morning to dusk. Few of his contemporaries were more attuned to nature's moods or to the timeless harmony of beast, landscape, and weather. Potter's strong feeling for composition is seen in the way he grouped forms and used silhouette. His most successful paintings are small.His contemporaries recognized Potter's talent. The famous Dr. Nicolas Tulp, who had spotted the young Rembrandt van Rijn's genius twenty years earlier, persuaded Potter to move to Amsterdam in 1652, whereupon he became Potter's mentor. In the 1800s, Potter's life-sizeThe Young Bullwas as famous as Rembrandt'sNight Watch.Potter's etchings show the same sensitivity as his paintings.", "occupation": "Painter"},

Pointing to his forehead, Gian Lorenzo Bernini called Poussin \"a painter who works up here.\" Born to Norman peasants, Poussin went to Paris in 1612, working with Mannerist artists and collaborating with Philippe de Champaigne. In Rome by 1624, he worked in Domenichino's studio, absorbing his composition and cool colors. \n\nPoussin's art developed slowly. His first major commission, an altarpiece for Saint Peter's Basilica, was unsuccessful; in fact, he never painted again for a public building in Rome but concentrated on small pictures for collectors. In 1640 Louis XIII persuaded him to supervise a large decorative project in Paris, but Poussin soon returned to Rome, suited neither for large projects nor for court intrigue and competition. He usually painted what he chose, on speculation rather than commission, a practice that led to reputation, not riches. Despite weak, shaky hands--which plagued him as early as 1643 and were probably a symptom of syphilis--Poussin painted by himself, lacking the resources required to run a large workshop with assistants and apprentices. His pictures, rather than pupils, shaped European art for generations. \n\nPoussin was the chief formulator of the French classical tradition in painting. By the mid-1630s, he began exploring a serene, classical style inspired by Raphael and antiquity, emphasizing form and moral content. His late works are essays in solid geometry, with movement minimized and every element given a symbolic meaning and pictorial function.", "occupation": "Painter"},

He exhibited with the Impressionists in 1886, with Les XX in Brussels, and was regarded as a leading Symbolist artist. Before committing to a career in the visual arts in the early 1870s, Redon studied architecture, music, literature, and art criticism. His earliest works, charcoal drawings characterized by mystery, melancholy, and fantasy, were championed by contemporary authors like St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Joris-Karl Huysmans. Redon's own interest in literature was reflected in his art. He produced drawings and lithographs inspired by the work of Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, and others.Until about 1890, Redon was known almost exclusively for his monochromatic work.. But his creative energies gradually moved toward color, and by 1900 he mostly produced oil paintings and pastels. As his art became more colorful, it also became more decorative, leading to commissions for screens and murals. He also produced decorative ensembles, the most ambitious being eighteen panels for the dining room of Baron de Domecy, a long-standing patron. But despite Redon's shifting interests, his fundamental aesthetic remained unchanged. Redon insisted on reference to nature, but nature filtered through memory and imagination, producing dream-like forms and dazzling surfaces.", "occupation": "draftsman; printmaker; painter"},

Five years later he was back in Parma, but by 1695 he had returned to Rome. He joined Rome's Accademia di San Luca in 1719 and gained an official position there in 1727. Rocca became renowned for precious, small-scale cabinet pictures of mythological and religious subjects. His cosmopolitan style was fundamentally sensual, with luminous pigmentation and rich painterly effects; this artistic vision aligned more closely with the emerging French Rococo than with his Roman colleagues' Baroque approach.Rome's artistic environment provided Rocca with the major elements of his style. Under Sebastiano Conca's influence, Rocca painted works that are often mistaken for Conca's. A fellow Italian painter's elegant, sweet manner also inspired Rocca; through him, Rocca may have met French painters working in Rome.

His most iconic works, such asThe Thinker,The Kiss,and the Burghers of Calaisare well known through multiple versions and numerous reproductions. At the same time, Rodin was an extremely gifted and prolific draftsman. Some of his drawings relate to his sculpture, while others are independent of it. The drawings in the latter category--mostly depictions of architecture or of the female body--may seem surprising at first, because they don't necessarily reflect the sculptor's sensibility for three-dimensional form.Rodin was born into a poor family in Paris in 1840. At 13, he enrolled at The Petite \u00c9cole, an applied-arts version of The \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts (Academy of Fine Arts). There, Rodin developed an ability to work in diverse styles, to draw from memory, and to render the human body in motion. At age 17, he applied to the more prestigious Academy but failed the entrance exam three times. Perhaps for that reason, Rodin detested \"academic\" art, favoring a more direct approach to the depiction of nature. Initially he earned a living designing and carving decorative stonework, most notably under the sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse. In 1871, Rodin moved to Brussels with Carrier-Belleuse in order to design public monuments. After visiting Italy in 1875 and finding inspiration in the sculptures he saw there, he gradually developed his own style. By1877, Rodin had returned to Paris. The French government awarded him a commission to design a grand entrance for a planned museum of decorative arts. That project, known as theGates of Hell, became Rodin's masterpiece. The museum was never built, however, and the monumental work remained unfinished at his death.Rodin's best-known sculptures were made in the 1880s, often stirring controversy for their bold depictions of nudity and sexual overtones. Rodin's portraits of French heroesVictor HugoandBalzacwere also considered avant-garde. Yet his style gradually became more widely accepted. An exhibition of his art, which he organized in Paris during the Universal Exposition of 1900, contributed to the establishment of his international reputation. After securing a sizeable estate in Meudon from the government (now a museum dedicated to the artist) Rodin died in 1917.", "occupation": "photographer; sculptor; draftsman"},

There he spent his summers, joined by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet and others who became known as the Barbizon School.Rousseau unified his compositions with muted tones and created rhythm through use of dark and light areas. His sincere, meticulous renderings seem to demonstrate his assertion that he made portraits of the trees and listened to their voices. Though he had detested his academic training, he never discarded one of its basic tenets: he considered his outdoor paintings to be merely sketches, preludes for the final paintings he worked up in his Paris studio each winter.When the 1841 Salon jury refused a painting that had already been purchased by the government, Rousseau quit submitting.

This element of chance is important to her work. \"My approach is usuallynotapproaching people with my camera,\" Rupp says. \" I do not ever really go up to someone with a camera and say, 'Can I take your picture?'\" She strikes up a conversation, first. The results are visible in the casual ease of her subjects, which forms an interesting counterpoint to her more deliberate concerns about color and print quality.Rupp credits her childhood in the Midwest for her life-long fascination with small-town America. Recalling a particular memoryof visiting relatives on a \"dirt farm\" in northwest Arkansas, she realized early an affinity for rural environments. In 1965 she earned a BA in sociology and psychology from Denison University in Granville, Ohio. She taught herself photography, then later returned to college to pursue it more formally. She earned an MFA in photography from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1982. Rupp credits the influences of photographers Helen Levitt for a candid approach and William Eggleston for his sense of color and interest in the quotidian, as well as anonymous familysnapshotsfor their casual ambiance.In the 1980s, Rupp documented Appalachian areas of Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky and returned to the mountainous region of Arkansas she remembered from her youth. She received recognition when her work was included in Museum of Modern Art curator Peter Galassi's influential 1991 exhibition,The Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort.

He had joined the Accademia di San Luca by 1607. In the early 1600s, Saraceni painted small-scale biblical and mythological subjects on copper, then a relatively new support in Rome. German artist Adam Elsheimer's style inspired the vast landscape settings that Saraceni began using so frequently and so well; their paintings were regularly confused.After Elsheimer and Caravaggio died in 1610, Saraceni seems to have inherited their market. Primarily occupied with public commissions, he painted numerousaltarpiecesin and around Rome. He grew increasingly interested in Caravaggio's art, painting larger figures, subtle light effects, and momentary actions. Elsheimer's influence remained equally strong: Saraceni continued creating Elsheimer-inspired poetic landscape backgrounds.

For much of his career Savery traveled widely, working for Rudolf II in Prague and then Emperor Matthias, before settling in Utrecht in 1619.The nearly ten years Savery worked for Rudolf II, beginning about 1603, were decisive. He traveled in Prague,Bohemia, and to the Tyrol, where he drew mountain scenery. These drawings provided source material for the rest of his career. While Savery's paintings recall Jan Brueghel the Elder's works, Savery's style is more archaic. He also incorporated the exotic animals that he studied closely in Rudolf II's menagerie. He must have even seen a now-extinct dodo bird, for it appears in one of his pictures.Savery's works played important roles in the development of severalgenres: floral still lifes, paintings of cows and other animals, cityscapes, and landscapes. His mountain scenes with precipitous rocks and waterfalls influenced Dutch landscape painters such as Allart van Everdingen, Herman Saftleven the Younger, and Jacob van Ruisdael.

The carpets, produced primarily for the royal family, were constructed of fine, close woolen pile, of approximately ninety knots per square inch. A skilled craftsman had to work a full year to make about two and one-half yards (three square meters) of plain carpet and even longer to make more complex patterns.Although carpets made to cover floors and tables were the factory's mainstay, it also produced wall-hangings, panels for folding screens, upholstery, and copies of oil paintings. Since the government prohibited the import of carpets from the East, the Savonnerie factory flourished. Among other splendid presents, the king of France,Louis XV, gave Savonnerie carpets to theOttomansultan in 1742; he particularly wanted to impress the sultan with the quality and richness of French carpets, woven on this occasion with borders of gold thread.The Savonnerie was joined with the Gobelins tapestry manufactory in 1825.

The small scale of Schalcken's early work and his careful study of textures, color, and light effects reflect that influence. The style of Gerrit Dou of Leiden, his second teacher, can be seen in Schalcken's interest in smallgenrepieces, painstaking detail, and frequent use of artificial lighting.After three years in Leiden, Schalcken returned to his native Dordrecht in 1665. Possibly under the influence of Frans van Mieris, he then adopted a freer touch, creating gentler transitions and using a lighterpalette. In these early years he painted genre and history subjects more than portraits. After the celebrated portraitist Nicolaes Maes left for Amsterdam in 1673, however, Schalcken became Dordrecht's most popular portrait painter. Between 1680 and 1690, Schalcken won international fame for his subtle rendering of natural and artificial light.

He worked easily in other artists' styles, particularly that of theItalianatemasters. His works are rare today, perhaps in part because he was so adaptable; they have often been wrongly attributed to other painters.Schellinks used his earlier drawings of England as the basis for his paintings of the successful 1667 naval raid on the English at Chatham during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, stressing the Dutch triumph by showing an English military contingent arriving too late.

He was probably in Venice by the late 1530s, where he was nicknamed \"Schiavone,\" or \"the Slav.\" His early training is unknown, though he was likely largely self-taught and studied Parmigianino's prints intensely.Schiavone had established himself by 1540 and introduced Mannerist modes and motifs into Venetian circles. His specialties included furniture panels, a format that encouraged a loose painting style. His large and ambitious canvases were unprecedented in their impressionistic use of paint, forcing Venetians to re-examine the acceptable range of painting. Schiavone's broad, free brushwork was indifferent to defining contours; his color decorated rather than described. Contemporaries complained about this lack of finish; one called Schiavone's use of impasto \"worthy of infamy.\" But younger artists like Jacopo Tintoretto and Jacopo Bassano, considered Schiavone's easel paintings and frescoes important models.After about 1550, Schiavone incorporated more naturalism. Though he retained his open brushwork and vibrating textures, his color harmonies grew darker and more complex, his forms denser, his emotion quieter and more grave. The inventive paint handling in his late works influenced such painters as Palma Il Giovane.

He is among the earliest fine art photographers to work almost exclusively in color. Shore became interested in photography as a child: Between the ages of six and ten he taught himself how to expose and print photographs. Walker Evans's book,American Photographs, made a big impression. At fourteen, the precocious teenager telephoned Edward Steichen, the photography curator of the Museum of Modern Art.

During theFranco-Prussian Warand the Paris Commune in the early 1870s, Sisley fled to London. The war caused him a severe reversal of fortune: most of his paintings were either lost or destroyed, and his father lost his fortune. Reduced to extreme poverty, Sisley had to support himself and his family through modest sales of his work. Not one for self-promotion, he never gained the recognition he deserved.Back in Paris, Sisley exhibited at the Impressionist exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, and 1882.

Sternfeld's projects have consistently explored the possibility of a collective American identity by documenting ordinary people and places throughout the country. Each project he embarks on is bound by a concept that imbues it with subtle irony, often through insightful visual juxtapositions or by pairing images with informational text. Another characteristic aspect of Sternfeld's work is that color is never arbitrary; it functions in highly sophisticated ways to connect elements and resonate emotion.Sternfeld earned a BA in Art from Dartmouth College in 1965. He began making color photographs in the 1970s after learning the color theory of Johannes Itten and Josef Albers. He initially made street photographs with small- and medium-format cameras, but by the time he produced what would become a seminal project,American Prospects(1987), he was working with an eight-by-ten-inch camera. This enabled him to achieve the crisp details his work is known for. Sternfeld's style-his careful attention to visual qualities combined with an insightful and often ironic view of his subjects was first articulated inAmerican Prospects.One of his best-known images, for example, depicts a fireman shopping for a pumpkin as a house burns in the background. The pumpkins' vibrant oranges match the autumnal colors of the countryside, and ironically, the fire's flames.Sternfeld continues to apply his studied observation of color to the everyday events and people he comes across as he travels.On This Site: Landscapes in Memoriam(1996) depicts sites where tragic events in American history occurred, including the places where Martin Luther King was murdered and Rodney King beaten. LikeAmerican Prospects,Stranger Passing(2001) became a travelogue of sorts. Instead of landscapes, however, Sternfeld made full-length portraits of the people he met during his journeys across America. Each picture tells a story via the person's physical appearance and the rich details of their surroundings. Other projects have focused on New York's Hart Island, historically used as a cemetery for the unknown and forgotten; the G8 summit in Geneva in July 2001, where \"anti-global\" protests turned violent; and the juxtaposition of old and new cultures in Italy's Campagna Romagna. More recently,Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America(2006) explores the sites of past and present idealized communities.

Early drawings depicting ancient monuments in Rome and Naples were probably copies of works by Jan Brueghel the Elder, rather than proof that Stevens went to Italy.

The court workshop reproduced Stevens's landscape designs inpietra durafor furniture decoration. Engravings also disseminated the designs.In Prague, Stevens's interest in light and atmospheric effects expanded these themes, which later became popular in Dutch art of the 1600s. He also developed landscape as an independent genre, without figures or animals. His coloristic tendencies were clearest in his drawings, when he changed his media from pen and dark ink against deep blue washes to brush and soft tones. He may have been influenced by Jan Brueghel the Elder's 1604 visit to Prague, for Brueghel used a similar wash technique.

Alongside this marble piece, Stouf exhibitedterracottastudies of the blind general Belisarius and an afflicted young woman.Stouf became best known for his commemorative portraits. In the 1700s, statues of virtuous and illustrious Frenchmen were extremely popular, both as records of public gratitude and to inspire the citizenry. Although Stouf looked toclassicalandBaroquesculpture for inspiration for his portraiture, his work also foreshadowed the Romantic sensibility of the 1800s. Among his known works, Stouf created studies for a planned monument to the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, marble statues of Saint Vincent de Paul andRenaissancescholar Michel de Montaigne, and a portrait of Abbot Suger. Several of Stouf's portraits were originally commissioned for a series of statues called the Great Men of France, intended to line the Grande Galerie of theLouvre.In the early 1800s, French sculpture was dominated by the cool linearity of the Empire style. But Stouf did not conform to this severe style. Throughout his career, he sought to simplify forms and emphasized large, evenly textured shapes. Despite being somewhat out of step with Empire tastes, Stouf continued to receive official commissions and is known to have exhibited at the Salons of 1817 and 1819.", "occupation": "sculptor"},

Punchinello, a physically deformed combination clown and bumpkin based specifically on a character from thecommedia dell'arte,became the protagonist of his work. In the 1790s, Tiepolo paintedfrescoesof Punchinello in his Venetian family villa and created a series of 104 drawings asEntertainments for the Children.These amusing and elaborately detailed drawings poked fun at pretensions and inspired viewers to reflect on their own behavior.", "occupation": "Painter; Draftsman; Printmaker"},

Though he lived in Paris, Tissot's caricature drawings frequently appeared in the popular English magazineVanity Fair. After France's devastating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Tissot relocated to London, where his established ties withVanity Fairand its influential publisher served him well. There, Tissot painted scenes of leisure and fashionable social occasions, such as couples strolling and fancy-dress balls, which were regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy. Toward the close of the 1870s, Tissot explored a renewed interest in printmaking and, partly inspired by an appreciation for Japanese metalwork, began producing cloisonn\u00e9 enamels.After his wife's death in 1882, Tissot returned to Paris, where he experimented with pastels and became popular as a portrait painter. The focus of Tissot's artwork shifted dramatically three years later, after he supposedly saw his dead wife at a s\u00e9ance. From then on, he devoted himself to religious subjects, making several trips to the Holy Land to do research. Before dying in 1902, Tissot completed 365 illustrations for the Life of Christ.

Legend suggests that at age nine Titian began training in Venice. He studied with Bellini, but Giorgione's influence was decisive: Titian's forms became larger, treatment of light subtler, and his mood gentler. In 1516 Titian became painter to the Venetian republic, and in 1533 Charles V named him court painter.Roman painting could match the grandeur of his forms, but Titian's brilliant, expressive color was unprecedented. His sensuousBacchus and Ariadneshowed his ability to depict any hue or texture. Titian's portraits combined incisive, sensitive characterizations with an opulent treatment of accessories, eventually developing into the official style that inspired Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and many artists of the 1800s.After 1555 Titian painted mythological works for Philip II of Spain, rising to new heights in creating sensuous flesh, with colors flowing in harmony rather than contrasting boldly as in his youth.

He specialized in this monochrome technique, different from his panels, which used strong, vivid colors.Paolo di Dono was Uccello's proper name. He was given the nickname Uccello, Italian word forbird,for his love of the winged creatures. But in his final years, Uccello was anything but free and uplifting, as his nickname would suggest. \"He came to live a hermit's life, hardly knowing anyone and shut away out of sight in his house for weeks and months at a time,\" said Vasari, who attributed his huge downfall to his obsession withperspective.", "occupation": "painter; draftsman; mosaicist"},

These large-scale paintings, representing imaginary visions of the classical past, earned Valenciennes the title, \"the David of landscape.\" In 1800, in an effort to raise the status of landscape painting, he published an ambitious and influential treatise,El\u00e9mens de perspective pratique.

His clients from Siena's churches and confraternities desired a more realistic style, following Counter-Reformation guidelines requiring painting to communicate clear stories to the populace.

In 1965 at age 21, he went to college in the United States and was stunned by the contrasts in wealth and lifestyles he saw.  He bought a camera before graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a BA in Sociology, and made street photographs in New York for several years. Although he enjoyed it, he realized he was retracing the steps of other documentary photographers. He decided instead focus on the \"built environment\" as a reflection of urban life, and returned to school while continuing to photograph. After earning an MA in Sociology from Columbia University in 1977, he developed a methodical approach to photographic documentation by researching his subjects, and systematically documenting them over time.Vergara takes his camera to places plagued by the drug trade, neighborhoods chosen for the location of homeless shelters, prisons, and drug treatment facilities, \"fringe\" streets flanked by railroad lines, expressways, cemeteries, and industrial corridors, and areas of gentrification. He is a prolific photographer who continues to live in New York City.

When Quellinus returned to Antwerp in 1665, Verhulst became the most prominent sculptor in the Netherlands. While residing in Leiden and then The Hague, Verhulst was engaged by a small but important network of privatepatronsin Holland.

Voluminous drapery, rounded forms, monumental formats, and smooth execution with moderately soft light and rich colors are common in his paintings.Victors's biblical scenes, often drawn from the Old Testament, frequently portray the theme of the constancy of the God of Israel. After 1650 Victors increasingly focused on street life: village peddlers, quacks, butchers, and craftsmen. Gradually, he incorporated influences from Pieter Lastman and Abraham Bloemaert, as well as Rembrandt's pupils Govaert Flinck and Gerbrand van den Eeckhout.

He lived in Italy from 1613 to 1627, mostly in Rome, but he also visited Venice, Naples, Bologna, and Genoa. Initially inspired by Caravaggio, Vouet also assimilated Italian Mannerism, Titian and Paolo Veronese's lyricism, and the art of the Carracci, Guercino, and Guido Reni. Famous and respected, he was president of Rome's Accademia di San Luca. \n\nRecalled to France by Louis XIII, Vouet dominated Paris, painting altarpieces and religious works for churches and illusionistic decorations for private home and public buildings, most of which have been destroyed. With Vouet, the French Baroque style was born.

Scholars have named him the Vouni Painter because one of his vases was found at the site of Vouni onCyprus.The work of the Vouni Painter is so close stylistically to that of another artist, the Timokrates Painter, that scholars believe they painted in the same workshop-if they are not in fact the same person.", "occupation": "Vase-Painter"},

His seemingly na\u00efve style and his pictures' rarity even have prompted speculation that he was an amateur. Scholars most often link Vrel's manner to Delft artists such as Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch, but elements in his street scenes may indicate connections to Haarlem, Friesland,Flanders, or the lower Rhineland. Scholars have attributed thirty-eight paintings depicting domestic interiors, courtyards, street scenes, and church interiors to Vrel. His only dated painting, from 1654, suggests that, rather than following, Vrel anticipated Delft artists' interest in domestic themes and light effects.Vrel rejected Dutch artists' traditional approach of describing surfaces in great detail. Instead, he created lofty spaces, often conveying an eerie feeling of emptiness. His interiors, with their curiously stunted furniture, frequently display a single woman, usually viewed from behind or in profile. His street scenes are unusual in their anonymity, showing unremarkable back streets and ordinary people. Vrel's painting technique--a straightforward manner without glazes or other refinements--complemented his unpretentious subjects.", "occupation": "painter"},

He was thirteen years old when he began using his father's second camera, a Graflex, in 1924. At that time, he abandoned formal schooling and was living with his father and his father's mistress, Tina Modotti, in Mexico. By 1932, Weston had shown work alongside his father's in several high-profile exhibitions and had been given his first museum retrospective.In the 1930s and '40s Brett Weston began to forge his own vision, which evolved into a seamless combination of the literal and the abstract. The 8-by-10-inch camera became his tool of choice. His early subjects were San Francisco and New York. These cityscapes playfully depict the architectural forms he came across, more than they record urban life. During the 1950s and beyond, Weston focused on the natural landscape, sometimes working side by side with his father to photograph sand dunes, boulders, and plants. Moving in close on subjects like broken glass or a weathered windowsill, Weston eliminated context in his pictures to invite abstraction.Weston spent about a year helping his ailing father print portfolios of his life's work.

No documented paintings by Ysenbrandt are known and only two were dated, but a body of work that continues David's style of devotional painting has been attributed to Ysenbrandt. Contemporary sources report that Ysenbrandt was famous and well-to-do. He held important posts in the Bruges Guild of Sculptors and Saddlemakers, and in 1520 he worked on the decorations for the Triumphal Entry ofEmperor Charles Vinto Bruges. Ysenbrandt's art also referred to the work ofJan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. He probably had a workshop, for his hand is sometimes found only in the faces and flesh parts of his paintings. Ysenbrandt's works are typically small and medium-sized idyllic scenes of religious subjects. He also painted portraits. Rocks rising vertically from the ground are typical of his style; he also added fashionableRenaissanceelements likeantiquepillars, volutes, and rams' heads. His landscape backgrounds often contain buildings resembling those in Jan Gosseaert's works.", "occupation": "painter"},
{"artist_name": "Jack Zajac", "nationality": "American", "birth_data_and_place": "b.  1929 Youngstown, Ohio", "long_biography": "Over more than fifty years, Jack Zajac has created a diverse body of sculptural work. His subjects have ranged from animal skulls to flowing water--disparate images united by a desire to capture natural forms and forces and to grapple with themes of purification, sacrifice, and rebirth.Zajac began painting at an early age. Shortly after his family moved from Ohio to Southern California, he began taking art classes at Scripps College in Claremont, California. He also worked at a steel mill, as a fisherman, bingo parlor caller, and caf\u00e9 fiddler. Over the next decade, Zajac received increased recognition for his painting which balanced representational elements like birds and the sea with abstraction.In 1954, Zajac received the Rome Prize, allowing him to spend an extended period in Rome. While exposed to that city's wealth of classical sculpture, he began sculpting. Many of Europe's most prominent sculptors also spent time in Rome during the post-war period including Marino Marini, Alberto Giacometti, and Giacomo Manz\u00f9. Among Zajac's earliest exhibited sculpture was a series of sacrificial animals--goats and lambs sprawled over a stake or bound on their backsides. He would return to this theme over the next several decades.During the 1960s, Zajac produced a series of monumental bronzes depicting ram's skulls, but also created more serene images. In polished stone and bronze, he represented falling water, breaking waves, and a swan form. These subjects would continue to preoccupy him for several decades. In 1974, Zajac began teaching at University of California, Santa Cruz. Now retired, Zajac continues to live and produce sculpture in Santa Cruz.", "occupation": "sculptor"},

He studied painting in Bologna, where he adopted the distinctive, gracefulRococopalette. Remaining primarily in Bologna, he created classicist paintings of biblicalmotifs.Zanotti knew many outstanding scholars and authors and wrote widely on art-related subjects. In 1710 he contributed a defense of Guido Reni's works in a controversy concerning the concepts of \"delicateness\" and \"weakness\" in painting. His written works also include a 1703 biography of his painting teacher; a revised edition of Carlo Cesare Malvasia's famous guidebook,Le pitture di Bolognafrom 1686; and a 1756 book about Pellegrino Tibaldi's paintings.In 1710 Zanotti became a founding member of the Accademia Clementina; his most famous written work is his two-volume history of the academy, written in 1739. The Accademia's goal was to instruct young students in the tradition established by the Carracci, most notably in retaining Bologna's excellence in life drawing from the nude. Most of Zanotti's later books also related to his activity in the Accademia.", "occupation": "Painter"},

Early on, he was influenced by Ferrarese masters such as Ercole de' Roberti, but by 1500, Leonardo's presence in Milan influenced his work. By 1513 Zenale seems to have begun devoting himself more to architecture than to painting. In 1519 he was elected architect of the MilanCathedral, and he became chief architect in 1522. He also wrote a treatise on the theory ofperspective. Zenale owned two houses and some land outside of Milan, indicating that he was probably a wealthy man.", "occupation": "painter; architect"},

Born Johannes Josephus Zauffaly in Germany, he apprenticed there under a pupil of Francesco Solimena, then studied in Italy, developing a decorativeRococostyle that incorporated minute, realistic detail. In England Zoffany discovered his gift for painting small group scenes. His technical brilliance and ability to create a theatrical effect set him apart and captured the attention of actor-manager David Garrick, who commissioned paintings of well-known actors onstage, usually in scenes from actual plays. Engraved in mezzotint, these \"theatrical pictures\" made Zoffany's reputation.Zoffany painted informal conversation pieces and portraits, gainingKing George III'spatronage. For the first time ever an artist depicted the king's family with a new informality. George III himself nominated Zoffany to the newRoyal Academyin 1769. Three years later Zoffany traveled to Italy and elsewhere in Europe, where hispalettewas enhanced by luscious reds, blues, and oranges. When he returned to England after seven years abroad, the vogue for conversation pieces was over, and Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough were supplying portraits. In 1783 he found a market in India, returning to England in 1789 a rich man but never regaining his 1760s popularity.", "occupation": "painter"},

Settling in Venice around 1732, two years after Marco Ricci's death, Zuccarelli became the city's leading landscape painter. The praises of his contemporaries, as above, underscore his popularity in his own time. In his softly colored, gentle landscapes, Zuccarelli placed more importance on lyricism than on realistic details. His Arcadian scenes with picturesque peasants earned an international reputation. In his landscapes, as a pun, Zuccarelli often included a figure with a gourd bottle, for zucco is Italian for \"gourd.\" \n\nThanks largely to Joseph Smith, Canaletto's patron, Zuccarelli's works developed a strong English market. Zuccarelli visited England from 1752 to 1762 and again from 1765 to 1771. He became a founding member and president of the Royal Academy and greatly influenced English landscape painting. Elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763, Zuccarelli became its president in 1772. He also worked in Paris and in the northern Italian town of Bergamo and spent his last years in Florence. Zuccarelli created innumerable drawings, some religious paintings, engravings, and tapestry designs.", "occupation": "Painter"},

His younger brother Federico Zuccaro later recorded his early career in Rome in a series of twenty drawings--from the rejection from his painter cousin's studio to the study of the HighRenaissancemasters.Taddeo Zuccaro borrowed elements from both the High Renaissance style andMannerism, combining figures of natural proportion and idealized form with intense emotion. Despite his early struggles as an artist, he became one of the most successful painters of the day, flooded with commissions and praised by his peers. When he completed the facade decorations for the Palazzo Mattei in 1548, the artist biographer Giorgio Vasari praised them and his reputation was secure. In 1559 Zuccaro began the decoration ofCardinalAlessandro Farnese's villa at Caprarola, a work which brought him further artistic prestige, life-long economic security, and a reputation as an able administrator of a large, busy studio. He also designedmaiolica, trophies, and festival decorations with his brother.

Zucchi's earliest drawing dates from a trip with Vasari to Pisa in 1561. In 1564 Zucchi entered the Accademia del Disegno and helped with Michelangelo's funeral decorations. He was also Vasari's chief assistant for theVaticandecorations in 1567 and 1572. Zucchi'sMannerismof this period combinesclassicism,naturalism, and Northern European influences incompositionsfilled with graceful, attenuated figures in exaggerated yet elegant movement.By 1572 Zucchi's relations with Vasari may have soured. He moved to Rome, where he was appointed artist in residence to theMedici court. He became a member of the Roman school, losing even his Tuscan accent. The Roman Mannerism that began with Raphael then enriched Zucchi's work, giving his forms fullness, depth of space, and greater ornamental opulence. Hisfrescoesin the Palazzo Rucellai and Palazzo di Firenze show Federico Zuccaro's influence, to which Zucchi added his own lively design. About thirty drawings are attributed to Zucchi, including pen sketches, brush andgouachecomposition sketches, and decorative architectural drawings.
