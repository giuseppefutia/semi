We do NOT charge credit card fees). We are an FFL operating out of South Bend Indiana and we ship all over the country. We are located at 2604 S Main st. in South Bend Indiana and share a facility with Mark's Auto Care Center. If you're local, feel free to stop by! Our hours are M-F: 9am to 530pm and Saturday: 9am to 2pm.      RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.       The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18\" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24\" available as the hunter variant. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item               Tweet                     Price:       $319.00           Manf.:      Kel-Tec          Model:      P3AT          Condition:      100% (NIB, New In the Box)                                                   Guns Online     Searchable Gun Database     Gun Classifieds         Dallas Guns -  For all your firearm needs!

These should not be confused with the Sterling Arms X- Caliber pistols of Lockport, NY. Ithaca manufactured the barrels for Sterling and are so marked. The pistols feature a unique firing pin system that detonates both rimfire and centerfire cartridges. From the information I garnered, according to S.P. Fjestad, author of the Blue Book of Gun Values, only about 300 units were ever produced in .22 LR and that production ceased due to unsolvable production problems. The specimens shown are marked Ithaca and are not only in New-in-box condition with owners manuals but, are UNASSEMBLED as they came from the factory. They feature 10\" barrels and contoured Goncalo Alves grips and forearms. My understanding is that the scope rail specimen in rarer, but I cannot verify that. Among the rarest of the rare single shot pistols ever manufactured, the Ithaca X-Caliber is seldom encountered. In fact, there were far fewer made than the Ruger Hawkeye. This is an opportunity to at-once own the two known variants that Ithaca released for sale. A must-have for any collector of the Ithaca brand or single shot pistols. No California sales. Purchaser assumes all FFL, shipping,handling and insurance fees.
